[1:2:66,85] of the individuals in its care back to their communities equipped with the tools to be drug-free, healthy, and employable

[1:4:66,105] environment.

[18:0:66,493] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[19:0:65,513] • Adult Inmate and Parolee Population—Compared to the 2019 Budget Act, the adult inmate average daily population is  

[19:1:76,523] projected to decrease by 3,335 in 2020-21, to a total of 122,536. Compared to 2019-20 at the 2019 Budget Act, the 2020  

[19:2:76,533] Budget Act projects an increase in the average daily parolee population of 1,432 in 2020-21, to a total of 51,874.  

[20:0:65,549] • Light Duty and Modified Work Assignments—The Budget includes $16.7 million General Fund annually for two years to  

[20:1:76,560] provide modified work assignment posts for staff with medical conditions, such as pregnancy, to provide them opportunities  

[20:2:76,570] to continue working or return to work earlier than would otherwise be possible.  

[21:0:65,586] • Reduce Reception Center Process to 30 days—The Budget includes reductions of $3.7 million General Fund and $121,000  

[21:1:76,596] Inmate Welfare Fund due to anticipated savings by implementing a more efficient process at the reception centers. It is  

[21:2:76,606] anticipated to reduce the current processing time of 90 to 120 days down to as little as 30 days. This will allow inmates to  

[21:3:76,617] begin participating in academic and rehabilitative programs sooner.  

[22:0:65,633] • Changes to Good Conduct Credits—The Budget includes reductions of $2.7 million General Fund and $170,000 Inmate  

[22:1:76,643] Welfare Fund due to anticipated changes in good conduct credits, applied prospectively. 

[23:0:65,659] • Consolidate Fire Camps—The Budget includes reductions of $7.4 million General Fund due to the consolidation of eight fire  

[23:1:76,669] camps that are currently not at capacity. CDCR will work with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL  

[23:2:76,680] FIRE) on the selection of the specific camps, taking into consideration proximity to other fire camps in an effort to minimize  

[23:3:76,690] impacts to communities that rely on the services provided by inmate fire crews.  

[24:0:65,706] • Intake Cell Retrofits for Suicide Prevention—The Budget includes $3.8 million one-time General Fund to retrofit 64 intake  

[25:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:122,29] 5225   Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:76,83] cells across the state to provide a safer environment for inmates entering segregated housing.  

[4:0:65,99] • Eliminate the Integrated Services for Mentally Ill Parolee Program—The Budget includes a reduction of $8.1 million General  

[4:1:76,109] Fund to eliminate the Integrated Services for Mentally Ill Parolee (ISMIP) program. The ISMIP program provides wraparound  

[4:2:76,119] services, including some transitional housing, for approximately 1,500 of 18,000 mentally ill parolees. However, the program  

[4:3:76,130] is costly and has shown limited effectiveness at reducing recidivism.   The Department will adjust policies to connect these  

[4:4:76,140] individuals with community resources, which ultimately provide better continuity of care long-term. Although the Budget  

[4:5:76,150] reduces funding for the program, statutory changes are necessary to eliminate the program.  

[5:0:65,166] • Suspension of the Transition-Aged Youth Pilot in the Division of Juvenile Justice—The Budget includes a reduction of $3.1  

[5:1:76,176] million ongoing General Fund to suspend the seven-year pilot program operated by the Division of Juvenile Justice to divert  

[5:2:76,187] transition-aged youth from adult prison to a juvenile facility. Currently, there is only one participant in the program who meets  

[5:3:76,197] the statutory criteria and, given the costs of the program, the pilot is not an effective use of resources. Although the Budget  

[5:4:76,207] reduces funding for this program, statutory changes are necessary to suspend the pilot.  

[6:0:65,223] • Division of Juvenile Justice Transition—The Governor’s Budget proposed to transfer the Division of Juvenile Justice to a  

[6:1:76,233] newly created independent department within the Health and Human Services Agency. The May Revision proposed instead  

[6:2:76,244] to transfer the responsibility for managing all youth to local jurisdictions and direct a portion of the state savings to county  

[6:3:76,254] probation departments. The Budget reflects the reversal of the transition, while the remainder of the proposal to realign youth  

[6:4:76,264] to counties will continue to be discussed over the next few months.  

[7:0:65,280] • Cap Parole Terms—The Budget includes a reduction of $23.2 million General Fund to establish supervision terms for certain  

[7:1:76,290] parolees at 24 months and establish earned discharge processes for non-Penal Code section 290 registrants at 12 months.  

[7:2:76,301] The Budget includes a reduction of funding associated with this proposal. However, statutory changes are necessary to

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,72] 4500 - CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION  

[5:0:66,90] The objective of the Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration program is to provide policy direction, accountability,  

[5:1:66,100] administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult and juvenile correctional and rehabilitation programs.  

[5:2:66,110] The program consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs;

[5:4:66,131] Labor Relations, Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; and the Office of the  

[5:5:66,141] Ombudsman.  

[6:0:66,159] 4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT

[7:1:66,187] managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/ 

[7:2:66,197] psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training and employee development for all  

[7:3:66,207] departmental staff.  

[8:0:66,225] 4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES  

[9:0:66,242] The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services  

[9:1:66,253] provided by the Department of Justice to CDCR.

[11:0:66,288] The Department accepts commitments from California courts when the person to be committed meets age requirements, can  

[11:1:66,298] materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there are adequate facilities available to care for the individual.  

[12:0:66,316] The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and  

[12:1:66,326] perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility  

[12:2:66,336] operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, juvenile offender intake and court services, population management  

[12:3:66,347] services, facility maintenance, and maintains juvenile offender master files. This program currently oversees operations for  

[12:4:66,357] three facilities and one conservation camp.  

[13:0:66,374] Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post  

[13:1:66,385] release planning for each offender. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based treatment  

[13:2:66,395] programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption therapy,  

[13:3:66,405] sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp programs,  

[13:4:66,415] and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior and

[16:1:66,509] Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development  

[16:2:66,519] preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State  

[16:3:66,530] Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education,  

[16:4:66,540] English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for  

[16:5:66,550] work experience.  

[17:0:66,568] 4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES

[3:0:66,83] 4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS  

[4:0:66,101] The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and  

[4:1:66,111] decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process.  

[5:0:66,128] For adult offenders, the Board of Parole Hearings is responsible for setting the terms and conditions of parole and conducting  

[5:1:66,139] parole consideration hearings for eligible inmates serving life sentences, including certain parole violators pursuant to Penal  

[5:2:66,149] Code Section 3000.1. In January 2014, the Board began conducting youth offender parole hearings for eligible offenders  

[5:3:66,159] sentenced under both the Indeterminate Sentence Law and Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to Chapter 312, Statutes of  

[5:4:66,169] 2013. In 2014, the Board also began conducting parole hearings for inmates eligible for elderly parole sentenced under both  

[5:5:66,179] the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to a federal court order. Beginning in January  

[5:6:66,190] 2015, the Board started evaluating certain inmates sentenced under the state's Second Strike Law for parole, pursuant to the  

[5:7:66,200] same federal court order. The Board also conducts medical parole hearings and determines whether parolees should be  

[5:8:66,210] discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for mentally disordered offenders and sexually violent predators, and  

[5:9:66,220] subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of Mental Health. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board  

[5:10:66,230] investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons and commutations of sentence, including those involving  

[5:11:66,241] the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the

[6:2:66,289] offender hearings to inmates who were under the age of 23 at the time of their offense. SB 261 specified that the Board  

[6:3:66,299] complete a new comprehensive risk assessment for each youth offender scheduled for a parole hearing that specifically  

[6:4:66,309] addresses the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to that of adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any  

[6:5:66,320] subsequent growth and increased maturity of the individual. Chapter 675, Statutes of 2017 (AB 1308) expands youth offender  

[6:6:66,330] hearings to inmates who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense.  

[7:0:66,347] For juvenile offenders, the Board of Juvenile Hearings is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from

[6:0:66,311] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and  

[6:1:66,322] technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal  

[6:2:66,332] justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety  

[6:3:66,342] Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention,  

[6:4:66,352] intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is  

[6:5:66,362] consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based  

[6:6:66,373] strategies for managing criminal justice populations.  

[7:0:66,393] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a  

[7:1:66,403] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[9:0:66,665] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries  

[9:1:66,675] in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate  

[9:2:66,685] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections  

[9:3:66,695] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee,  

[9:4:66,705] the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker  

[9:5:66,716] of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the

[3:0:66,83] Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the  

[3:1:66,93] Board.  

[4:0:66,113] The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good  

[4:1:66,124] work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA  

[4:2:66,134] work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming.  

[5:0:66,154] The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that  

[5:1:66,164] provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within  

[5:2:66,175] enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work  

[5:3:66,185] productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work  

[5:4:66,195] programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services  

[5:5:66,205] to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its  

[5:6:66,215] operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
