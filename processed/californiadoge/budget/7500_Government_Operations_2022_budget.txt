[6:3:66,310] return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the collection and

[10:0:66,408] The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides  

[10:1:66,418] centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and  

[10:2:66,428] construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building;  

[10:3:66,438] printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's  

[10:4:66,448] vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve  

[10:5:66,459] California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions.  

[10:6:66,476] Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support

[4:2:66,109] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds  

[4:3:66,120] are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public  

[4:4:66,130] building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school  

[4:5:66,140] districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)  

[4:6:66,150] Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.  

[5:0:66,168] 6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[6:0:66,188] The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and  

[6:1:66,199] equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties.  

[7:0:66,216] 6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES  

[8:0:66,237] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid  

[8:1:66,247] redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate  

[8:2:66,257] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring   protection of lives and  

[8:3:66,267] property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified  

[8:4:66,277] parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their  

[8:5:66,288] programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies,  

[8:6:66,298] and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and  

[8:7:66,308] ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners.  

[9:0:66,326] 6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES  

[10:0:66,346] To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are  

[10:1:66,356] essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and  

[10:2:66,367] leveraged procurement agreements for   information   technology   and non-information technology   goods and services, green and  

[10:3:66,377] sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing  

[10:4:66,387] small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing  

[10:5:66,397] the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include  

[10:6:66,407] travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy  

[10:7:66,418] efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human resources services.  

[10:8:66,428] Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct quasi-judicial hearings  

[10:9:66,438] and mediations authorized by law.  

[11:0:66,456] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[12:0:66,476] The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This  

[12:1:66,486] program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services,  

[12:2:66,496] auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative  

[12:3:66,507] services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training,   information technology, health and safety, and  

[12:4:66,517] departmental procurement and contracting.

[6:0:66,244] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[7:0:66,264] • The Budget includes $2.9 billion Proposition 2 debt repayment funding for a supplemental pension payment in 2022-23 to  

[7:1:66,274] further reduce the state’s CalPERS unfunded liability. This is a supplemental payment in addition to the estimated $8.2 billion  

[7:2:66,284] contribution that the state is statutorily-required to make to CalPERS in 2022-23. Contribution estimates incorporate retirement  

[7:3:66,294] rates corresponding to the recent discount rate change from 7 percent to 6.8 percent. Based on current projections, an  

[7:4:66,304] additional $5 billion in Proposition 2 funding is planned to be paid to CalPERS over the remaining forecast period (fiscal years  

[7:5:66,315] 2023-24 to 2025-26) depending on the future availability of those funds.  

[8:0:66,332] • Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $143 million within the  

[8:1:66,342] Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s portion of a loan from the Surplus Money  

[8:2:66,353] Investment Fund. This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement  

[8:3:66,363] plans in 2017-18.

[13:0:105,348] 2/ This display does not reflect the $2.9 billion supplemental pension payment to the California Public Employees'  

[13:1:105,359] Retirement System (CalPERS) in 2022-23 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in  

[13:2:105,369] the 2022 Budget Act. This display does not reflect the supplemental pension payments to CalPERS state plans included  

[13:3:105,378] in the 2019 Budget Act, 2020 Budget Act, or 2021 Budget Act. 

[14:0:105,401] 3/ The 2022 Budget Act estimates 2022-23 state contributions to CalPERS to be $7,474,890,000. The decrease in this  

[14:1:105,412] estimate from the 2022-23 Governor's Budget to the 2022 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans'  

[14:2:105,421] employer contribution rate, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2022 meeting. 

[15:0:105,434] 4/ The 2022 Budget Act estimates 2022-23 administrative expenditures to be $457,192,000, as approved by the CalPERS  

[15:1:105,445] Board of Administration at its April 2022 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2022-23 Governor's Budget to the  

[15:2:105,455] 2022 Budget Act reflects anticipated increases in personal services and operating expenses and equipment captured in  

[15:3:105,464] the expenditures approved in April 2022.
[16:0:105,487] 5/ The 2022 Budget Act estimates 2022-23 other expenditures to be $1,178,765,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of  

[16:1:105,498] Administration at its April 2022 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2022-23 Governor's Budget to the 2022  

[16:2:105,508] Budget Act is primarily due to an increase in investment external management fees and technology expenses.

[1:0:411,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — GOP   81 

[2:0:143,32] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 6410 - RETIREMENT  

[5:0:66,103] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for  

[5:1:66,113] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of  

[5:2:66,123] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2021, there were about 1,327,000 active and inactive members, and  

[5:3:66,133] about 751,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.  

[6:0:66,154] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  

[6:1:66,164] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,  

[6:2:66,174] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract  

[6:3:66,184] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit  

[6:4:66,194] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.  

[7:0:66,215] As of June 30, 2021, there were 2,892 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and  

[7:1:66,225] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their  

[7:2:66,235] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency  

[7:3:66,245] retirement systems.  

[8:0:66,266] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.  

[9:0:66,283] 6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY  

[10:0:66,304] CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the  

[10:1:66,314] federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age,  

[10:2:66,324] Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.   As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the  

[10:3:66,334] liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.   The program is responsible for  

[10:4:66,345] administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting  

[10:5:66,355] and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 

[11:0:66,373] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS  

[12:0:66,393] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee  

[12:1:66,403] associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees,  

[12:2:66,413] retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs,  

[12:3:66,424] provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer  

[12:4:66,434] representatives.  

[13:0:66,454] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,  

[13:1:66,464] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all  

[13:2:66,475] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial  

[13:3:66,485] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.  

[14:0:66,502] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS  

[15:0:66,523] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the  

[15:1:66,533] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired  

[15:2:66,543] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'  

[15:3:66,553] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $477.3 billion, as of June 30, 2021.  

[16:0:66,571] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,589] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of  

[17:1:66,599] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy  

[17:2:66,609] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term  

[17:3:66,619] Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

[1:0:206,69] 7910   Office of Administrative Law  

[2:0:66,91] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state  

[2:1:66,101] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these  

[2:2:66,111] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also  

[2:3:66,121] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been  

[2:4:66,131] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through  

[2:5:66,142] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative  

[2:6:66,152] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members  

[2:7:66,162] of the public regarding California rulemaking law.  

[3:0:66,182] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies  

[3:1:66,193] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the  

[3:2:66,203] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.  

[4:0:66,223] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the  

[4:1:66,233] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[8:0:187,418] 7920   State Teachers' Retirement System  

[8:1:66,439] The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution  

[8:2:66,450] plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred  

[8:3:66,460] compensation plans and programs:  

[8:4:65,477] • State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP)  

[9:0:65,494] • CalSTRS Pension2 Personal Wealth Plan (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans)  

[9:1:65,510] • Teachers' Health Benefits Fund  

[9:2:65,526] • Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund  

[10:0:66,544] CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school  

[10:1:66,554] teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of  

[10:2:66,564] June 30, 2021, there were over 980,000 members, retirees, and beneficiaries in the STRP Defined Benefit Program.  

[11:0:66,585] CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement  

[11:1:66,595] Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

[7:1:66,313] Defined Benefit Plan from the previous fiscal year is largely due to an additional $174 million one-time General Fund payment  

[7:2:66,324] in 2021-22. See 6300 - State Contribution to the State Teachers' Retirement System for more information.

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS  

[4:0:66,105] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the  

[4:1:66,115] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the  

[4:2:66,126] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement  

[4:3:66,136] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may  

[4:4:66,146] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the  

[4:5:66,156] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's  

[4:6:66,166] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or  

[4:7:66,177] contract provisions.  

[5:0:66,197] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the  

[5:1:66,207] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of  

[5:2:66,217] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
