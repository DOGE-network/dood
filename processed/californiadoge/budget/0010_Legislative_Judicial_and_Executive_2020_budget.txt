[13:2:66,653] and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  

[13:3:66,671] Because the Legislature's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to

[11:1:66,496] The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was  

[11:2:66,506] completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for  

[11:3:66,516] construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.   The Annex, which was  

[11:4:66,526] completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices.  

[11:5:66,544] Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored,  

[11:6:66,554] rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

[7:0:139,276] 0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System  

[7:1:66,297] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional  

[7:2:66,307] officers, and legislative statutory officers.  

[8:0:66,328] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of  

[8:1:66,338] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,  

[8:2:66,348] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.   The Legislators'  

[8:3:66,358] Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 

[9:0:66,379] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November  

[9:1:66,389] 6, 1990.   Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340)  

[9:2:66,399] closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory  

[9:3:66,409] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[6:0:208,190] 0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau  

[6:1:66,211] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members  

[6:2:66,222] and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The  

[6:3:66,232] legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of legislative  

[6:4:66,242] committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is  

[6:5:66,252] confidential.  

[7:0:66,273] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative  

[7:1:66,283] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes.  

[8:0:66,303] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative  

[8:1:66,313] information system and the processing of legislative measures.  

[9:0:66,334] Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the

[9:0:242,495] 0250   Judicial Branch  

[10:0:66,516] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of  

[10:1:66,527] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.  

[10:2:66,537] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially  

[10:3:66,547] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.  

[11:0:66,567] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent  

[11:1:66,578] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was  

[11:2:66,588] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This  

[12:0:66,598] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The  

[12:1:66,608] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty  

[13:0:66,618] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments  

[13:1:66,629] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted  

[13:2:66,639] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act  

[13:3:66,649] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the  

[13:4:66,659] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial  

[13:5:66,669] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are  

[13:6:66,680] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of  

[14:0:66,690] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities  

[14:1:66,700] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.

[3:0:66,83] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,  

[3:1:66,93] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United  

[3:2:66,103] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.  

[4:0:66,124] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay

[1:0:414,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — LJE   17 

[2:0:207,29] 0250   Judicial Branch - Continued 

[3:0:66,102] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[3:1:65,122] • Trial Court Trust Fund Shortfall—The Budget includes an additional $238.5 million one-time General Fund in 2020-21 to  

[3:2:76,132] backfill declining fine and fee revenues: $90.9 million in 2019-20 and $147.6 million for 2020-21.  

[3:3:65,148] • Judicial Branch Budget Reductions—The Budget includes baseline reductions of $176.9 million General Fund for the trial  

[3:4:76,158] courts and $23.1 million General Fund for the state level judiciary in 2020-21. However, If the federal government provides  

[3:5:76,168] sufficient funding by October 15, 2020, $126.9 million for the trial courts and $23.1 million for the state level judiciary will be  

[3:6:76,179] restored in 2020-21.  

[4:0:65,195] • Resources to Fund Additional Workload from COVID-19—The Budget includes $50 million one-time General Fund in  

[4:1:76,205] 2020-21 to help the trial courts address the backlog in cases stemming from COVID-19 and resume normal operations.  

[4:2:65,221] • Trial Court Employee Benefits—The Budget includes $30 million ongoing General Fund for trial court employee health  

[4:3:76,231] benefit and retirement costs, which brings the total funding for this purpose to $180.5 million.  

[4:4:65,248] • Modernization of Court Operations—The Budget includes $25 million General Fund in 2020-21 and 2021-22 for modernizing  

[4:5:76,258] court operations with the goal of achieving efficiencies and increasing access to court services online. The Judicial Council  

[4:6:76,268] may allocate this funding for projects such as enabling electronic case filing, digitizing documents, resolving disputes online,  

[4:7:76,278] and utilizing video technology to facilitate remote participating in hearings.  

[5:0:65,294] • Language Access—The Budget includes $9.9 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $9.6 million annually thereafter for  

[5:1:76,305] increased costs for court interpreters and to purchase equipment for the newly established Video Remote Interpreting  

[5:2:76,315] Program. This will bring total funding for court interpreters to $132 million annually.  

[5:3:65,331] • County Law Libraries Backfill—The Budget includes $7 million one-time General Fund in 2020-21 to backfill County Law  

[5:4:76,341] Libraries for lost revenue due to the reduction in civil case filings from COVID-19.  

[5:5:65,357] • Litigation Management Program—The Budget includes $437,000 General Fund in 2020-21 and annually thereafter for the  

[5:6:76,368] Judicial Branch to pay for legal defense services provided by the Department of Justice.

[22:1:82,613] funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[23:0:82,620] 2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees. 

[23:1:82,628] 3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 superior courts based on courts' final certified 2019-20 Schedule 1 submissions.  

[24:0:82,635] 4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in section 1 in anticipation of their allocation. 

[25:0:82,643] 5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’  

[25:1:82,649] state funding in Section 1. 

[26:0:82,656] 6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and  

[26:1:82,662] Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total  

[26:2:82,667] expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total". 

[27:0:82,673] 7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences. For the current  

[27:1:82,679] year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[28:0:82,686] 8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2018-19 and estimated expenditures for 2019-20 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2019-20 Enacted Budget. 

[29:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[16:0:38,359] 1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF), General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers'  

[16:1:38,367] Compensation Fund (JBWCF). The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed  

[16:2:38,375] dependency counsel). 

[17:0:38,383] 2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions"  

[17:1:38,392] display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State  

[17:2:38,399] Trial Court Funding Total".  

[18:0:38,415] 3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the  

[18:1:38,423] Trial Court Information section ($131.2 million in 2018-19 and $137.1 million in 2019-20). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In  

[18:2:38,430] addition, 23 courts in 2018-19 and 2019-20 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.
[19:0:38,440] 4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program.  

[19:1:38,448] Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. 

[20:0:38,457] 5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF. For  

[20:1:38,466] the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.

[6:0:180,277] 0280   Commission on Judicial Performance  

[7:0:66,298] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of  

[7:1:66,308] judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California  

[7:2:66,318] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of  

[7:3:66,329] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or  

[7:4:66,339] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.  

[7:5:66,349] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.  

[8:0:66,369] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial  

[8:1:66,380] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation  

[8:2:66,390] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal  

[8:3:66,400] from office.  

[9:0:66,420] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the  

[9:1:66,431] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,  

[9:2:66,441] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.  

[9:3:66,451] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[1:0:150,83] 0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System  

[2:0:66,105] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and  

[2:1:66,115] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement  

[2:2:66,125] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.  

[3:0:66,143] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in  

[3:1:66,153] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System  

[3:2:66,163] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final  

[3:3:66,173] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement  

[3:4:66,184] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of  

[3:5:66,194] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined  

[3:6:66,204] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives  

[3:7:66,214] contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted  

[3:8:66,224] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.  

[4:0:66,245] The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,  

[4:1:66,255] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges  

[4:2:66,265] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing  

[4:3:66,275] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit  

[4:4:66,286] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the  

[4:5:66,296] required benefit payments to retired judges.  

[5:0:66,316] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of  

[5:1:66,326] 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[7:0:199,293] 0552   Office of the Inspector General  

[8:0:66,314] The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional  

[8:1:66,324] system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's  

[8:2:66,334] (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, staff complaints, and the employee disciplinary process. The Inspector  

[8:3:66,345] General audits and reviews the policies, practices, and procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's  

[8:4:66,355] candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the  

[8:5:66,365] state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at  

[8:6:66,375] each state prison. OIG receives communications from individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-

[8:7:66,385] free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of  

[8:8:66,396] complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper management where a legally cognizable cause of action is  

[8:9:66,406] present; and reviews sexual abuse incidents within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the  

[8:10:66,416] state correctional system by publicly reporting its findings.  

[9:0:66,434] In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various mental  

[9:1:66,444] health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at least twice  

[9:2:66,454] annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment programs. The Board  

[9:3:66,464] also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of  

[9:4:66,474] treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of offender participation  

[9:5:66,485] and success.

[0:0:66,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — LJE   110 

[1:0:382,13] LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[2:0:167,29] 0690   Office of Emergency Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting against,  

[3:1:66,93] responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats.  

[4:0:66,111] Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal  

[4:1:66,121] agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in  

[4:2:66,131] emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own  

[4:3:66,141] resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the  

[4:4:66,152] federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.  

[5:0:66,169] During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's  

[5:1:66,179] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal  

[5:2:66,190] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the  

[5:3:66,200] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes  

[5:4:66,210] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  

[6:0:66,228] Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and  

[6:1:66,238] the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS  

[6:2:66,248] assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of   and response to criminal and terrorist activity and   also facilitates  

[6:3:66,258] information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners.  

[6:4:66,276] The Budget reflects the transfer of the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety   Commission to the Office of Emergency Services  

[6:5:66,286] beginning in 2020-21.  

[7:0:66,304] Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this  

[7:1:66,314] need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[8:0:66,335] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[9:0:65,354] • Community Power Resiliency—The Budget includes $50 million one-time General Fund for additional preparedness  

[9:1:76,364] measures to bolster community resiliency. Building on the state’s 2019-20 power-resiliency investments, critical services still  

[9:2:76,374] vulnerable to power outage events include schools, county election offices, and food storage reserves.  

[10:0:65,390] • California Earthquake Early Warning System—The Budget includes $17.3 million California Earthquake Safety Fund in  

[10:1:76,401] 2020-21, which relies on a one-time $17.3 million School Land Bank Fund loan while ongoing revenue options continue to  

[10:2:76,411] be evaluated and pursued. These funds will support the system operations and program management, an education and  

[10:3:76,421] outreach campaign, and research and development to expand earthquake mitigation uses.  

[11:0:65,437] • California Cybersecurity Integration Center—The Budget includes three-year limited-term funding of $7.6   million General  

[11:1:76,447] Fund in 2020-21 and $8.1   million in 2021-22 and 2022-23 to support additional capacity within the California Cybersecurity  

[11:2:76,458] Integration Center, consistent with the requirements of Government Code section   8586.5. This funding is part of a  

[11:3:76,468] collaborative effort between the Department of Technology, Office of Emergency Services, California Military Department,  

[11:4:76,478] and the California Highway Patrol.  

[12:0:65,494] • Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center (SB 209)—The Budget includes $2 million ongoing General  

[12:1:76,504] Fund for OES—in conjunction with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, California Public Utilities Commission,  

[12:2:76,515] and California Military Department—to establish and operate the Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center,  

[12:3:76,525] consistent with the requirements of Chapter 405, Statutes of 2019 (SB 209).  

[13:0:65,541] • Transfer of the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission to the Office of Emergency Services—The Budget reflects the  

[13:1:76,551] transfer of the Commission, its six positions, and associated funding to Cal OES beginning in 2020-21. To support this  

[13:2:76,561] transfer, the Budget includes $2.5   million ($503,000 General Fund) in 2020-21 and $2.4   million ongoing ($351,000 General  

[13:3:76,572] Fund). As part of the state’s broader preparedness efforts, the Commission will be better positioned to provide a coordinated  

[13:4:76,582] framework for establishing earthquake safety policies and recommendations, and tracking the state’s progress toward higher  

[13:5:76,592] levels of seismic safety. The Budget also proposes a reduction in the number of appointed Commissioners from 20 to 15 and  

[13:6:76,602] an expansion of the entities required to provide updates to the Commission on earthquake preparedness and seismic safety  

[13:7:76,612] activities.

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,72] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES  

[5:0:66,93] Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program  

[5:1:66,103] coordinates the provision   of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended  

[5:2:66,113] in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-

[5:3:66,123] hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National  

[5:4:66,134] Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this  

[5:5:66,144] program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to  

[5:6:66,154] all hazards.  

[6:0:66,172] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,189] Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services  

[7:1:66,200] grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland  

[7:2:66,210] Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency  

[7:3:66,220] management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant  

[7:4:66,230] management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with  

[7:5:66,240] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the  

[7:6:66,251] centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion  

[7:7:66,261] center.  

[8:0:66,278] 0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION  

[9:0:66,296] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent  

[9:1:66,306] earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s  

[9:2:66,317] progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.   The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate,  

[9:3:66,327] and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.   The  

[9:4:66,337] Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support  

[9:5:66,347] the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.   These activities include: (1) developing and  

[9:6:66,357] reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related  

[9:7:66,368] legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies,  

[9:8:66,378] where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and  

[9:9:66,388] supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery.  

[9:10:66,406] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS  

[10:0:66,426] The Public Safety Communications   program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the  

[10:1:66,436] state's   public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The   program is dedicated to the  

[10:2:66,446] preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that  

[10:3:66,457] keep the public connected during times of crisis.  

[10:4:66,474] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE  

[11:0:66,495] The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of   Cal OES and support services such as

[7:1:66,376] Under California's Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor serves as Acting Governor whenever the Governor is absent from the  

[7:2:66,386] state, and automatically becomes Governor if a vacancy occurs in the Office of Governor. The Lieutenant Governor is also  

[7:3:66,396] President of the Senate and votes in case of a tie.

[9:1:66,457] Commission, which oversees the control and leasing of millions of acres of state-owned land, including offshore oil resources,  

[9:2:66,467] as well as use and permitting for all navigable waterways in California. The Commission also manages state land-use planning  

[9:3:66,478] and revenues, and related interstate issues. During alternate years, when the Lieutenant Governor serves as Chairperson of  

[9:4:66,488] the State Lands Commission, the Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of the Ocean Protection Council   and as a  

[9:5:66,498] non-voting member of the California Coastal Commission.  

[10:0:66,518] In addition, under state statutes, the Lieutenant Governor chairs the California Commission for Economic Development, which

[11:0:224,509] 0820   Department of Justice  

[12:0:66,530] The constitutional office of the Attorney General, as chief law officer of the state, has the responsibility to see that the laws of  

[12:1:66,540] California are uniformly and adequately enforced. This responsibility is fulfilled through the diverse programs of the Department  

[12:2:66,551] of Justice.  

[13:0:66,571] The Department of Justice is responsible for providing skillful and efficient legal services on behalf of the people of California.  

[13:1:66,581] The Attorney General represents the people in all matters before the Appellate and Supreme Courts of California and the  

[13:2:66,591] United States; serves as legal counsel to state officers, boards, commissioners, and departments; represents the people in  

[13:3:66,602] actions to protect the environment and to enforce consumer, antitrust, and civil laws; and assists district attorneys in the  

[13:4:66,612] administration of justice. The Department provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms/ 

[13:5:66,622] dangerous weapon laws; provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence; regulates legal gambling activities in  

[13:6:66,632] California; supports the telecommunications and data processing needs of the California criminal justice community; and  

[13:7:66,642] pursues projects designed to protect the people of California from fraudulent, unfair, and illegal activities.

[15:1:76,431] Erskine Wildfire.

[16:3:76,478] consolidate and centralize healthcare litigation within the Department of Justice.  

[17:0:65,494] • Firearms: Precursor Parts (Chapter 730, Statutes of 2019 (AB 879))—The Budget includes $5.9 million General Fund in  

[17:1:76,504] 2020-21 and $8.3 million in 2021-22 to regulate and track the sale of firearm precursor parts. Given the risk that such guns  

[17:2:76,514] present to public safety, the Budget includes resources to accelerate the implementation of these requirements to July 1,  

[17:3:76,524] 2022.

[21:1:76,671] Sale Special Account for the initial planning and analysis phase of a new firearms system that will combine 11 existing

[8:1:66,264] civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them, and prosecutes cases to vindicate state  

[8:2:66,275] interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative  

[8:3:66,285] tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and  

[8:4:66,295] California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of   nine sections: Business and Tax; Cannabis Control; Correctional Law;  

[8:5:66,305] Employment and Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education, and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement;  

[8:6:66,315] Licensing; or Tort and Condemnation.  

[9:0:66,336] Criminal Law represents the   People of the State of California   in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts.

[10:0:216,459] 0845   Department of Insurance  

[11:0:66,480] California's publicly-elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the fourth largest insurance economy in the world with insurers  

[11:1:66,490] collecting more than $310 billion in premiums annually in California while protecting consumers and the integrity, health and  

[11:2:66,501] vitality of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is "Insurance Protection for All  

[11:3:66,511] Californians." CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their dealings with  

[11:4:66,521] insurers, and using innovation to improve services for insurance producers and consumers.  

[12:0:66,539] The CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, the CDI oversees and licenses  

[12:1:66,549] approximately 1,400 insurance companies and approximately 420,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents,  

[12:2:66,559] brokers, adjusters and bail agents. Additionally, the CDI receives and investigates approximately 200,000 consumer inquiries  

[12:3:66,569] and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than  

[12:4:66,579] approximately 23,000 suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 6,800 rate filing  

[12:5:66,590] applications annually; and works in conjunction with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and  

[12:6:66,600] prosecute fraudulent insurance practices.

[13:0:66,460] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[13:1:65,480] • Enhanced Fraud Investigation and Prevention (Fraud Data Analytics/eDiscovery)—The Budget includes $840,000 General  

[13:2:76,490] Fund to support the Fraud Data Analytics Software (FDAS) system and the eDiscovery Software-as-a-Service solution,  

[13:3:76,500] which are currently used by the Fraud Division within the California Department of Insurance to perform fraud investigations  

[13:4:76,510] of civil whistleblower cases related to the California Insurance Fraud Prevention Act, Insurance Code section 1871.7, et seq.  

[13:5:76,520] Updates to the algorithms of the FDAS system will help the Fraud Division continue to select cases with the greatest impact  

[13:6:76,531] on the industry and/or cases that have the greatest potential to benefit California consumers, while remaining relevant as  

[13:7:76,541] fraud patterns change. The renewal of the eDiscovery software reduces the time spent on processing, reviewing, and  

[13:8:76,551] organizing discovery data, which provides attorneys the ability to initiate independent investigations into large scale  

[13:9:76,561] fraudulent schemes.  

[14:0:65,577] • Workers' Compensation Fraud Program—The Budget includes $3.4 million Insurance Fund to support workers’  

[14:1:76,588] compensation fraud investigation and prosecution workload increases, which aligns with the increased assessment  

[14:2:76,598] approved by the Fraud Assessment Commission in September 2019. The goal of this program is to arrest, prosecute, and  

[14:3:76,608] convict perpetrators who commit workers’ compensation insurance fraud and to provide anti-fraud outreach and training to  

[14:4:76,618] the public, private, and governmental sectors.

[8:0:66,415] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:0:66,434] 0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS  

[10:0:66,452] The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of  

[10:1:66,462] insurers, including the review of complex, principles-based reserving methods to avoid reliance on black box models; (2)  

[10:2:66,472] prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and casualty  

[10:3:66,482] insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code and the  

[10:4:66,493] California Code of Regulations; (4) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance sector; (5)  

[10:5:66,503] review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and attempt to get unreasonable rates  

[10:6:66,513] lowered by insurers; and (6) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and  

[10:7:66,523] maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and Liquidation Office, the CDI administers the estates of  

[10:8:66,533] insolvent and delinquent insurance companies.  

[10:9:66,551] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION  

[11:0:66,571] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders  

[11:1:66,582] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating or  

[11:2:66,592] underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or fraudulent practices or  

[11:3:66,602] incompetence relating to the sale of insurance and (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities.  

[11:4:66,620] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL  

[12:0:66,637] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for  

[12:1:66,648] prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed  

[12:2:66,658] by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program  

[12:3:66,668] administers the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes the department to conduct criminal insurance fraud  

[12:4:66,678] investigations. In addition, the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower "qui tam" actions  

[12:5:66,688] seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud.  

[12:6:66,706] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE  

[13:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[8:0:183,450] 0850   California State Lottery Commission  

[9:0:66,471] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an  

[9:1:66,481] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it  

[9:2:66,492] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to  

[9:3:66,502] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by  

[9:4:66,512] the State Senate.  

[10:0:66,532] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34  

[10:1:66,543] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be  

[10:2:66,553] used for administrative costs.  

[11:0:66,573] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost  

[11:1:66,583] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of  

[11:2:66,594] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery  

[11:3:66,604] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily  

[11:4:66,614] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the  

[11:5:66,624] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.  

[12:0:66,645] In the 34 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2019, the California State Lottery has raised $36.0 billion  

[12:1:66,655] for public education, including $1.85 billion in FY 2018-19.  

[13:0:66,675] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2019-20 and 2020-21 cannot be made  

[13:1:66,685] with certainty.

[8:0:66,355] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:1:66,375] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES  

[9:0:66,395] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption.  

[9:1:66,405] During the 2018-19 fiscal year, this Division handled 8,649 security investment transactions totaling $394.7 billion. The Pooled  

[9:2:66,415] Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 7,225 of these transactions totaling $360 billion; time deposits  

[9:3:66,426] accounted for 1,139 transactions totaling $27.9 billion. The remaining $7.2 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special  

[9:4:66,436] funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's  

[9:5:66,446] retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment  

[9:6:66,456] program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the  

[9:7:66,466] 2018-19 fiscal year, 2,405 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $21.7 billion for the fiscal year.  

[9:8:66,484] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT  

[10:0:66,502] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System  

[10:1:66,512] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires  

[10:2:66,522] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,  

[10:3:66,532] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,  

[10:4:66,543] and loans to the General Fund.  

[11:0:66,560] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of  

[11:1:66,570] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that  

[11:2:66,581] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer  

[11:3:66,591] maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for  

[11:4:66,601] the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies.  

[12:0:66,619] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts  

[12:1:66,629] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer  

[12:2:66,639] of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for  

[12:3:66,649] payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities  

[12:4:66,660] pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other  

[12:5:66,670] state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or  

[12:6:66,680] pledged to the state.

[3:1:66,93] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The  

[3:2:66,103] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to  

[3:3:66,113] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.  

[4:0:66,134] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse  

[4:1:66,144] consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance   includes monitoring  

[4:2:66,154] the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and  

[4:3:66,164] ensuring proper record keeping.  

[5:0:66,182] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES  

[6:0:66,200] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support

[7:0:165,328] 0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee  

[7:1:66,349] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State  

[7:2:66,359] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,  

[7:3:66,369] such as the creation of affordable housing.  

[8:0:66,390] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual  

[8:1:66,400] basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by  

[8:2:66,410] multiplying the state population by $105. California's limit totaled over $4.1 billion in 2019. (California's limit for the Qualified  

[8:3:66,420] Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $396  

[8:4:66,431] million for 2019.)  

[9:0:66,451] The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers  

[9:1:66,461] authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state  

[9:2:66,471] or federal government.  

[10:0:66,492] The Committee administers five active programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private  

[10:1:66,502] activity bonds.   The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the  

[10:2:66,512] Governor, or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

[10:0:66,508] 0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[11:0:66,528] To lower the cost of financing, specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that  

[11:1:66,538] support below-market interest rate mortgage loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that reduce a homebuyer's federal  

[11:2:66,548] tax liability. Below is a summary of each program:  

[12:0:66,569] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily  

[12:1:66,579] rental housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers  

[12:2:66,589] produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and  

[12:3:66,599] families. To qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or  

[12:4:66,610] reserve at least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can  

[12:5:66,620] apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit  

[12:6:66,630] Allocation Committee Joint Application.  

[13:0:66,650] Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs to assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes.  

[13:1:66,661] Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program  

[13:2:66,671] participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations.  

[14:0:66,691] Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds  

[14:1:66,701] issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and  

[14:2:66,712] midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their

[13:0:66,533] The Authority was established to assist transportation agencies in obtaining financing to develop transportation projects. To  

[13:1:66,543] meet this objective, statutes allow the Authority to issue, or to approve specified project sponsors to issue revenue bonds to  

[13:2:66,553] fund transportation projects backed in whole or in part, by various revenue streams of transportation funds (including toll  

[13:3:66,564] revenues). Statutes provide the authority to approve the imposition and collection of tolls on proposed transportation projects  

[13:4:66,574] under certain conditions. The planning, programming, and allocation of transportation projects are performed by the California  

[13:5:66,584] Transportation Commission and the California Department of Transportation, as appropriate.

[11:2:66,624] maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming  

[11:3:66,634] partnerships with developers, investors and public entities.  

[12:0:66,654] The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years  

[12:1:66,664] after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with federal and state tax credit program requirements of the Committee.  

[12:2:66,675] Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create and  

[12:3:66,685] maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing.  

[13:0:66,705] The Committee consists of seven members, including five voting members and two advisors. The voting members are the

[5:0:66,181] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,201] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[7:0:66,221] The Federal Program  

[8:0:66,242] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax  

[8:1:66,252] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise  

[8:2:66,262] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and  

[8:3:66,272] indexed for inflation. 

[9:0:66,293] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the  

[9:1:66,303] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability  

[9:2:66,313] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of  

[9:3:66,323] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project  

[9:4:66,333] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each  

[9:5:66,344] year for a ten-year period.  

[10:0:66,361] The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation.   For 2019, each  

[10:1:66,371] state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.76 per   state resident.   Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share  

[10:2:66,382] of unused credits in a national pool.  

[11:0:66,399] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects  

[11:1:66,410] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there  

[11:2:66,420] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments.  

[12:0:66,437] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires  

[12:1:66,448] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.  

[13:0:66,476] The State LIHTC Program  

[14:0:66,496] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the  

[14:1:66,506] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for  

[14:2:66,516] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax  

[14:3:66,527] credit status.  

[15:0:66,547] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2019, was $100.4 million. Investors take the state tax credit  

[15:1:66,557] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.  

[16:0:66,575] Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee to issue $500 Million in state tax  

[16:1:66,585] credits to be paired with the 4% federal program to bolster new construction of low income housing.  

[17:0:66,605] Farmworker Housing Program  

[18:0:66,626] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state  

[18:1:66,636] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,  

[18:2:66,646] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and  

[18:3:66,656] projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.  

[19:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[5:1:279,198] Authority  

[5:2:66,219] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes  

[5:3:66,230] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently  

[5:4:66,240] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the  

[5:5:66,250] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  

[5:6:66,260] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,  

[5:7:66,270] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and  

[5:8:66,281] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit  

[5:9:66,291] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities  

[5:10:66,301] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.  

[6:0:66,321] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director  

[6:1:66,332] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,  

[6:2:66,342] and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[6:0:66,373] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:0:66,393] 0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY  

[8:0:66,413] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the  

[8:1:66,423] authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as  

[8:2:66,434] determined and approved by resolution of the Authority.  

[9:0:66,454] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative  

[9:1:66,464] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012, expanded  

[9:2:66,474] the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter  

[9:3:66,485] 768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock  

[9:4:66,495] and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product.   In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of  

[9:5:66,505] 2019, extended the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job  

[9:6:66,515] creation-related criteria by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. The objective of this program is to promote the creation  

[9:7:66,525] of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution,  

[9:8:66,536] and energy consumption.  

[10:0:66,556] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013  

[10:1:66,566] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority  

[10:2:66,576] developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for residential  

[10:3:66,587] whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for residential Property  

[10:4:66,597] Assessed Clean Energy programs in California.  

[11:0:66,617] The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in  

[11:1:66,627] collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot programs   employ various  

[11:2:66,638] types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending   (in both the residential and commercial  

[11:3:66,648] sectors).   The pilot programs also lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making   energy efficiency  

[11:4:66,658] improvements needed to help achieve the state's   energy efficiency goals.

[10:1:66,522] accessible to small businesses, and delivering innovative financing for projects that protect and restore the environment. The  

[10:2:66,532] Authority was created to assist the solid waste, recycling, water, and wastewater industries through its Pollution Control Tax-

[10:3:66,542] Exempt Bond Program. Over the last twenty-five years, the Authority has evolved to provide financing assistance to California's  

[10:4:66,552] small business sector through its California Capital Access Program (CalCAP), and to promote the reuse and redevelopment of  

[10:5:66,562] brownfields through the California Recycle Underutilized Sites Program (CALReUSE).  

[11:0:66,583] The Authority consists of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the State Controller, and the Director of the Department of

[9:0:66,455] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:66,474] 0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,494] The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the  

[11:1:66,504] acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment,  

[11:2:66,515] waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority  

[11:3:66,525] assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989.  

[11:4:66,535] As of June 30, 2019, bonds totaling approximately $16.1 billion have been issued by the Authority.  

[11:5:66,553] 0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  

[12:0:66,573] The objective of this program is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. CalCAP  

[12:1:66,583] for Small Businesses is a form of loan loss recovery that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By  

[12:2:66,594] participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the financing needs of  

[12:3:66,604] California's small businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating  

[12:4:66,614] financial institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional  

[12:5:66,624] incentives are provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk,  

[12:6:66,634] allowing banks to lend to targeted California small businesses.  

[13:0:66,652] Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA's Small Business Assistance Fund (SBAF)  

[13:1:66,662] established by fees collected from large companies financed through CPCFA's Pollution Control tax-exempt bond program.   In  

[13:2:66,672] October 2010, Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts.   The  

[13:3:66,683] $6 million appropriation of   the State-funded program account was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual  

[13:4:66,693] recapture of contributions to become the primary source for the State's contributions.  

[14:0:66,713] In addition, in 2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from the federal State  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:116,29] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The allocation was shared between the Authority, $85 million, and   the Governor's  

[3:1:66,93] Office of Business and Economic Development (Go-BIZ), $83   million.   These funds enabled the Authority to expand the  

[3:2:66,103] availability of its CalCAP for Small Business program statewide.   The Authority also launched the   Collateral Support Program   to  

[3:3:66,113] assist small businesses with more substantial capital needs.   The federal funds   were expended by the fourth quarter of 2018. 

[3:4:66,124] Funds are being   recaptured annually to sustain both the CalCAP for Small Business and the Collateral Support programs.  

[4:0:66,144] Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck  

[4:1:66,154] and equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $167.9 million in Air Quality Improvement  

[4:2:66,164] Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The  

[4:3:66,175] Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit  

[4:4:66,185] enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations.  

[5:0:66,203] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,223] The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived  

[6:1:66,233] contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties  

[6:2:66,243] (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program  

[6:3:66,254] provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000, which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with  

[6:4:66,264] brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible  

[6:5:66,274] projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or  

[6:6:66,284] perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process.  

[7:0:66,305] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund  

[8:0:66,315] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received  

[8:1:66,325] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project   for   brownfield remediation that  

[8:2:66,335] promotes affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. All CALReUSE Program funds have been awarded. The  

[8:3:66,345] CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,439 housing units in 30 California  

[8:4:66,356] communities.  

[9:0:66,373] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS  

[10:0:66,391] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative  

[10:1:66,401] energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's  

[10:2:66,411] environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and  

[10:3:66,422] state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.  

[11:0:66,439] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT  

[12:0:66,460] The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal  

[12:1:66,470] Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other  

[12:2:66,480] financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the  

[12:3:66,490] Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the  

[12:4:66,500] CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program.  

[13:0:66,518] 0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM  

[14:0:66,539] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time  

[14:1:66,549] allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement   program for   qualified small businesses  

[14:2:66,559] and residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of  

[14:3:66,569] Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other  

[14:4:66,579] financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the  

[14:5:66,590] program.

[10:0:66,545] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:1:66,564] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD  

[11:0:66,584] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which  

[11:1:66,595] allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can  

[11:2:66,605] make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings.  

[11:3:66,615] ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability  

[11:4:66,625] expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the  

[11:5:66,635] State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.  

[12:0:66,656] The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the  

[12:1:66,666] purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse  

[12:2:66,676] needs of our customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in  

[12:3:66,686] providing financial services.  

[13:0:66,704] Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $16,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's  

[13:1:66,714] ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[9:0:66,387] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:1:66,406] 0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,427] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance  

[10:1:66,437] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and  

[10:2:66,447] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,  

[10:3:66,457] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB  

[10:4:66,467] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.  

[10:5:66,485] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,505] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program  

[11:1:66,516] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the  

[11:2:66,526] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University  

[11:3:66,536] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50  

[11:4:66,546] percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the  

[11:5:66,556] state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be  

[11:6:66,567] deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements.  

[11:7:66,584] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM  

[12:0:66,605] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School  

[12:1:66,615] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.  

[12:2:66,625] Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities  

[12:3:66,635] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on  

[12:4:66,646] preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and  

[12:5:66,656] demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding.  

[12:6:66,673] 0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM  

[13:0:66,694] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and

[5:0:66,181] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,201] 0940 - BOND FINANCING  

[7:0:66,218] CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational  

[7:1:66,229] facilities.   Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds,   CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms  

[7:2:66,239] than might otherwise be obtainable.   CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the  

[7:3:66,249] construction of student and faculty housing.   Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or  

[7:4:66,259] the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions.   The full faith and credit of the participating  

[7:5:66,269] institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds.   Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private  

[7:6:66,280] activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law.  

[8:0:66,297] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private  

[8:1:66,308] college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's ethnicity, provided that the financing does not  

[8:2:66,318] violate constitutional provisions.  

[9:0:66,338] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness.   This broad definition allows CEFA to  

[9:1:66,348] issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than  

[9:2:66,358] these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.  

[10:0:66,378] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND  

[11:0:66,398] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the  

[11:1:66,408] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017.   Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,  

[11:2:66,419] added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January  

[11:3:66,429] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018.   Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax  

[11:4:66,439] credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
