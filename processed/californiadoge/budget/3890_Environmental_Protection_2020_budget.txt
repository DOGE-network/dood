[1:0:227,53] 3900   Air Resources Board  

[2:0:66,75] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes  

[3:0:66,85] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in  

[3:1:66,95] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.  

[4:0:66,105] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans  

[4:1:66,116] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air  

[4:2:66,126] pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for  

[5:0:66,136] Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40  

[5:1:66,146] percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB  

[5:2:66,156] 32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's  

[5:3:66,167] most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air  

[5:4:66,177] pollution control districts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement  

[5:5:66,187] all of its programs.  

[6:0:66,207] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay  

[6:1:66,218] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[7:0:66,202] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:0:65,221] • Exide Oversight Funding—The Budget includes $1 million Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund annually for two years for the  

[8:1:76,231] department to oversee and implement the remaining activities needed for the Exide 2014 Stipulation and Order and the  

[8:2:76,241] ongoing Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective action work at the former Exide facility in the City of Vernon.  

[8:3:76,251] The Budget also includes $600,000 Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund annually for two years for the department to hire a  

[8:4:76,262] third-party contractor to oversee the closure of the former Exide facility in the City of Vernon.  

[9:0:65,278] • Base Funding to Maintain Operations—The Budget includes $7.777 million General Fund on a one-time basis to backfill the  

[9:1:76,288] Toxic Substances Control Account and an additional $1 million General Fund on a one-time basis to backfill the Hazardous  

[9:2:76,298] Waste Control Account (for a total 2020-21 backfill amount of $19.5 million for the Hazardous Waste Control Account). This  

[9:3:76,308] funding will keep the Toxic Substances Control Account and Hazardous Waste Control Account out of deficit in 2020-21 and  

[9:4:76,319] maintain current service levels.  

[10:0:65,335] • Cost Recovery Management System Information Technology Project—The Budget includes $2.71 million on a one-time  

[10:1:76,345] basis split between the Hazardous Waste Control Account, Toxic Substances Control Account, and the Lead Acid Battery  

[10:2:76,355] Cleanup Fund for procurement and implementation of the Cost Recovery Management System Information Technology  

[10:3:76,365] project. This project will replace the existing Cost Recovery Billing System and will enhance the department’s cost recovery

[5:0:66,307] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,327] 3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,344] The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund  

[7:1:66,354] program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,259 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups,  

[7:2:66,365] and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 238 sites where the cleanup process is complete.  

[7:3:66,375] Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,066 land-use restrictions in  

[7:4:66,385] place on properties throughout the state.  

[8:0:66,403] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other  

[8:1:66,413] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to  

[8:2:66,423] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties,  

[8:3:66,433] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military  

[8:4:66,444] installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former  

[8:5:66,454] hazardous waste disposal site.  

[9:0:66,471] The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness  

[9:1:66,482] for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills  

[9:2:66,492] and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.  

[10:0:66,510] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT  

[11:0:66,527] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of  

[11:1:66,537] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at  

[11:2:66,548] 104 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous  

[11:3:66,558] waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300  

[11:4:66,568] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[11:5:66,578] assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of  

[11:6:66,588] the Unified Program.  

[12:0:66,606] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[12:1:66,616] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste  

[12:2:66,627] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused  

[12:3:66,637] enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste  

[12:4:66,647] and used oil.  

[13:0:66,665] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS  

[14:0:66,682] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic  

[14:1:66,693] chemicals. The SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by eliminating or reducing their use of hazardous  

[14:2:66,703] chemicals which may harm people or the environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in  

[14:3:66,713] products in order to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:1:66,93] encourages the adoption of "green chemistry" practices.  

[3:2:66,111] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY  

[4:0:66,128] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)  

[4:1:66,139] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified  

[4:2:66,149] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for  

[4:3:66,159] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response  

[4:4:66,169] plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements  

[4:5:66,179] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.  

[5:0:66,197] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,215] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities  

[6:1:66,225] surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program, the  

[6:2:66,235] department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including residences, schools, daycare  

[6:3:66,245] centers, and parks within a 1.7-mile radius of the facility. The program will cleanup contaminated soil at those properties with  

[6:4:66,256] the highest levels of lead in soil and greatest potential for exposure.  

[6:5:66,273] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[7:0:66,291] The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management,  

[7:1:66,301] information management, and business services. The program also provides legal counsel, external communication, analytical  

[7:2:66,311] chemistry support, environmental justice and tribal affairs consultation, and public participation services.
