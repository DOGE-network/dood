[1:0:242,39] 3100   Exposition Park  

[2:0:66,61] The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are  

[2:1:66,71] located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these  

[2:2:66,81] three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park.  

[3:0:66,99] The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park  

[3:1:66,109] usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of  

[3:2:66,119] the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve,  

[3:3:66,129] and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the  

[3:4:66,139] western United States.  

[4:0:66,157] Because   the Science Center's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the   Science Center   has a capital outlay  

[4:1:66,167] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,268] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,287] 2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER  

[7:0:66,308] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and  

[7:1:66,318] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops  

[7:2:66,328] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.  

[8:0:66,349] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological  

[8:1:66,359] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,  

[8:2:66,369] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary  

[8:3:66,379] home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its  

[8:4:66,389] permanent home - is completed.  

[9:0:66,410] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The  

[9:1:66,420] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and  

[9:2:66,430] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a  

[9:3:66,440] Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The  

[9:4:66,451] school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards.  

[10:0:66,471] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those  

[10:1:66,481] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding  

[10:2:66,491] support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.  

[11:0:66,509] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,527] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management  

[12:1:66,537] and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events,  

[12:2:66,547] and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is  

[12:3:66,557] responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of  

[12:4:66,568] park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park  

[13:0:66,578] Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in  

[13:1:66,588] addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood.  

[14:0:66,606] 2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM  

[15:0:66,623] The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the  

[15:1:66,634] Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of  

[15:2:66,644] African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African  

[15:3:66,654] American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear  

[15:4:66,664] campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility  

[15:5:66,674] in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public  

[15:6:66,685] programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture,  

[15:7:66,695] historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and  

[15:8:66,705] to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at  

[15:9:66,715] large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty

[4:0:201,148] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy  

[5:0:66,169] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational  

[5:1:66,179] resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs  

[5:2:66,190] that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants for or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed  

[5:3:66,200] restoration; and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances  

[5:4:66,210] these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by  

[5:5:66,220] acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.  

[6:0:66,241] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to  

[6:1:66,251] restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.   The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the  

[6:2:66,261] Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed  

[6:3:66,271] to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[6:4:66,281] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 

[7:0:66,302] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program  

[7:1:66,312] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[11:0:66,616] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[11:1:66,636] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY  

[12:0:66,653] The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-

[12:1:66,664] acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have  

[12:2:66,674] significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits  

[12:3:66,684] and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments.  

[12:4:66,694] Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the  

[12:5:66,704] Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities,  

[12:6:66,715] including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe.  

[13:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:166,32] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to  

[3:1:66,79] more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a  

[3:2:66,89] wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also  

[3:3:66,99] increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire,  

[3:4:66,109] clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This  

[3:5:66,120] work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change.  

[4:0:66,137] The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site  

[4:1:66,148] improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating  

[4:2:66,158] public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake.  

[4:3:66,175] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  

[5:0:66,196] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing  

[5:1:66,206] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide  

[5:2:66,216] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds  

[5:3:66,226] such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.  

[6:0:66,244] In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting  

[6:1:66,254] urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive  

[6:2:66,265] Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town  

[6:3:66,275] center objectives.   Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other  

[6:4:66,285] environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

[7:0:66,522] floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at  

[7:1:66,532] public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become  

[7:2:66,542] strong workers and citizens.  

[8:0:66,562] In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that  

[8:1:66,573] are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities.  

[9:0:66,593] Because the   CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this  

[9:1:66,603] need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[10:1:66,547] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and  

[10:2:66,558] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets; and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,  

[10:3:66,568] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about  

[10:4:66,578] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.  

[10:5:66,596] 2425 - GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[11:0:66,613] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as   much  

[11:1:66,624] as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and  

[11:2:66,634] environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of  

[11:3:66,644] hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for  

[11:4:66,654] program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries. 

[11:5:66,672] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION  

[12:0:66,690] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program  

[12:1:66,700] provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local  

[12:2:66,710] governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts

[3:0:66,69] for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development  

[3:1:66,79] rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops  

[3:2:66,89] maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use  

[3:3:66,99] decisions.  

[3:4:66,117] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION  

[4:0:66,135] This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface  

[4:1:66,145] Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim  

[4:2:66,155] mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and  

[4:3:66,165] remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.  

[4:4:66,183] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD  

[5:0:66,201] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of  

[5:1:66,211] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine  

[5:2:66,221] Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans,  

[5:3:66,231] and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to  

[5:4:66,241] comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local  

[5:5:66,252] government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

[5:0:164,398] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  

[6:0:66,420] The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue, and  

[6:1:66,430] disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership in the protection of life, property, and natural resources in  

[6:2:66,440] California.  

[7:0:66,460] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety  

[7:1:66,471] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency  

[7:2:66,481] response.  

[8:0:66,501] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing  

[8:1:66,511] diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention  

[8:2:66,522] awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management.  

[9:0:66,542] CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to  

[9:1:66,552] enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland  

[9:2:66,562] areas of California.  

[10:0:66,583] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support  

[10:1:66,593] this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[11:0:66,493] 2465 - FIRE PROTECTION  

[12:0:66,513] CAL FIRE provides fire protection services to help limit damages to life, property, and natural resources. The objective is to  

[12:1:66,523] quickly and aggressively attack fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct protection responsibility by virtue of  

[12:2:66,533] law, contract, or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and follow-up action is relative to values  

[12:3:66,544] threatened and control difficulty, with the goal to control all unwanted fires under CAL FIRE's jurisdiction within the first  

[12:4:66,554] operational period.  

[13:0:66,571] 2465010 - Fire Prevention:  

[14:0:66,592] This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression  

[14:1:66,602] cost recovery, and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials, and procedures to  

[14:2:66,612] mitigate hazards and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be  

[14:3:66,622] done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of firefighting, property loss, injury to the public and firefighters,  

[14:4:66,633] and damage to the environment.  

[15:0:66,650] 2465019 - Fire Control:  

[16:0:66,671] The objective of this program is to detect, respond to, and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility  

[16:1:66,681] Area using an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 10 acres or less. This  

[16:2:66,691] is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, bulldozers, helicopters,  

[16:3:66,701] and fixed wing aircraft.

[6:1:66,155] Justice, operates 30 conservation camps throughout the state that house fire crews. CAL FIRE also operates 4 Fire Centers  

[6:2:66,165] with the California Conservation Corps (CCC) throughout the state that house 12 fire crews, and there are an additional 4 fire  

[6:3:66,175] crews as part of the Ventura Training Center Program. These crews provide one of the primary labor forces for firefighting,  

[6:4:66,186] emergency response, and conservation-related work projects.  

[7:0:66,203] 2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression:  

[8:0:66,224] CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope  

[8:1:66,234] with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was  

[8:2:66,244] incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management  

[8:3:66,254] Agency or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of this cost  

[8:4:66,265] through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes.  

[9:0:66,282] 2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  

[10:0:66,303] California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands, and urban forests provide multiple human, climate, and  

[10:1:66,313] environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to  

[10:2:66,323] these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by the regulation of timber harvesting,

[5:0:215,187] 3560   State Lands Commission  

[6:0:66,208] The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its  

[6:1:66,219] care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access.  

[6:2:66,229] Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars   in  

[6:3:66,239] revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources.  

[7:0:66,257] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands  

[7:1:66,267] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign  

[7:2:66,277] public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal  

[7:3:66,287] government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands  

[7:4:66,297] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development,  

[8:0:66,308] environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law  

[9:0:66,318] Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the  

[9:1:66,328] trust to the benefit of all Californians.  

[10:0:66,346] Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and  

[10:1:66,356] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high  

[10:2:66,366] water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands,  

[11:0:66,376] which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California.  

[11:1:66,387] School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the  

[11:2:66,397] five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state  

[12:0:66,407] ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest  

[12:1:66,417] in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

[5:0:66,154] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,173] 2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[7:0:66,191] The   Mineral Resources Management Division   oversees the efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands.  

[7:1:66,201] The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the  

[7:2:66,211] safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,  

[7:3:66,222] geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public  

[7:4:66,232] safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources  

[7:5:66,242] through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil  

[7:6:66,252] spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and   conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives  

[7:7:66,262] fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the  

[7:8:66,273] oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction.  

[8:0:66,290] Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-

[8:1:66,300] generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to  

[8:2:66,311] administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program.  

[9:0:66,328] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[10:0:66,346] The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural  

[10:1:66,356] and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public  

[10:2:66,366] Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from   Lake  

[10:3:66,377] Tahoe and   the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast   in the west, and include California’s  

[10:4:66,387] two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin.  

[11:0:66,405] The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local  

[11:1:66,415] jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The

[9:0:197,373] 3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife  

[10:0:66,395] The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the  

[10:1:66,405] habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological value and for their use and enjoyment by the public.  

[11:0:66,425] This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to protect the survival of species and  

[11:1:66,436] natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational,  

[11:2:66,446] commercial, scientific, and educational uses.  

[12:0:66,466] Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[12:1:66,476] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[12:2:66,487] Overview."

[4:0:66,89] This program encourages the preservation, conservation, maintenance, and restoration of wildlife resources, including the  

[4:1:66,99] Ecosystem Restoration Program, under the jurisdiction and influence of the state. Activities involve the conservation, protection  

[4:2:66,109] and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat to ensure maintenance of biologically sustainable populations of  

[4:3:66,120] those species.  

[5:0:66,137] 2595 - HUNTING, FISHING, AND PUBLIC USE PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,155] This program facilitates diverse and sustainable hunting, fishing (recreational and commercial), trapping, and other public uses  

[6:1:66,165] and associated economic benefits to the state by conserving and managing game species. Activities include collection and  

[6:2:66,175] assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of game fish and wildlife to determine appropriate regulations

[10:1:66,358] community and stakeholder outreach; and information and data using a variety of methods including publications,  

[10:2:66,369] presentations, web applications, and media relations.  

[10:3:66,386] 2615 - SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,407] This program minimizes damage and environmental impacts to, restores, and rehabilitates California's fish and wildlife  

[11:1:66,417] populations and their habitats from the harmful effects of oil and other deleterious material spills in marine waters and inland  

[11:2:66,427] habitats.  

[11:3:66,445] 2620 - FISH AND GAME COMMISSION  

[12:0:66,463] The California Fish and Game Commission ensures the long term sustainability of California's fish and wildlife resources by  

[12:1:66,473] guiding the ongoing scientific evaluation and assessment of California's fish and wildlife resources; setting California's fish and  

[12:2:66,483] wildlife resource management policies and ensuring these are implemented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife;  

[12:3:66,493] establishing appropriate fish and wildlife resource management rules and regulations; and building active fish and wildlife

[9:3:66,419] recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources;  

[9:4:66,430] and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. The Commission is also designated the  

[9:5:66,440] principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone Management Act in  

[9:6:66,450] California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal development projects,  

[9:7:66,460] and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be subject to state control.

[8:0:183,316] 3790   Department of Parks and Recreation  

[9:0:66,338] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and  

[9:1:66,348] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most  

[9:2:66,358] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and  

[9:3:66,368] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the  

[9:4:66,379] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural  

[9:5:66,389] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park  

[9:6:66,399] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and  

[9:7:66,409] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,  

[9:8:66,419] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,  

[9:9:66,430] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing  

[9:10:66,440] financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.  

[10:0:66,460] Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need.  

[10:1:66,470] For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:408,13] 2021-22 STATE BUDGET — RES   221 

[2:0:161,32] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water  

[3:1:66,79] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to  

[3:2:66,89] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water  

[4:0:66,99] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water  

[4:1:66,109] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan  

[4:2:66,120] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,  

[4:3:66,130] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,  

[4:4:66,140] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected  

[4:5:66,150] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare  

[4:6:66,160] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure  

[4:7:66,171] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,  

[4:8:66,181] protection of agriculture, and supporting a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water  

[4:9:66,191] Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local  

[4:10:66,201] agencies and tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination.  

[5:0:66,219] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM  

[6:0:66,237] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21  

[6:1:66,247] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,  

[6:2:66,257] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.  

[7:0:66,275] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water  

[7:1:66,285] to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.  

[8:0:66,303] The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,  

[8:1:66,313] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental  

[8:2:66,323] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and  

[8:3:66,333] federal regulations and permits.  

[9:0:66,351] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE  

[10:0:66,369] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper  

[10:1:66,379] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include  

[10:2:66,389] assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use  

[10:3:66,399] of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities,  

[10:4:66,409] coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in  

[10:5:66,420] cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way  

[10:6:66,430] for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and the  

[10:7:66,440] reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities  

[10:8:66,450] associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The  

[10:9:66,460] program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety.  

[11:0:66,478] 3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD  

[12:0:66,499] The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) facilities,  

[12:1:66,509] designated floodways, and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by  

[12:2:66,519] issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that  

[12:3:66,529] protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San  

[12:4:66,539] Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large  

[12:5:66,550] joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than   100 local maintaining agencies that operate and  

[12:6:66,560] maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for  

[12:7:66,570] stakeholders.

[14:2:66,626] information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies.  

[15:0:66,643] 3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING  

[16:0:66,661] California Energy Resources Scheduling is responsible for managing the Electrical Power Fund and the Department of Water  

[16:1:66,671] Resources (DWR) Charge Fund. For a limited period of time, the Electrical Power Charge Fund purchased electric power on  

[16:2:66,682] behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. The Department retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering  

[16:3:66,692] revenue bonds issued to repay the General Fund for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and  

[16:4:66,702] funding of reserve accounts necessary to maintain an investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.   The

[6:0:66,468] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[6:1:66,487] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control  

[6:2:66,497] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage  

[6:3:66,507] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700  

[6:4:66,517] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated  

[6:5:66,528] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate  

[6:6:66,538] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the  

[6:7:66,548] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank  

[6:8:66,558] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,  

[6:9:66,568] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood  

[6:10:66,579] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[11:0:211,438] 3885   Delta Stewardship Council  

[12:0:66,460] Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is  

[12:1:66,470] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and  

[12:2:66,480] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and  

[13:0:66,490] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted  

[13:1:66,501] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.  

[13:2:66,511] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other  

[13:3:66,521] relevant agencies.   The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent  

[13:4:66,531] Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to  

[13:5:66,541] inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
