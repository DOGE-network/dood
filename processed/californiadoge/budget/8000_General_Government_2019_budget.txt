[7:0:66,302] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:1:66,321] 6500 - STANDARDS  

[8:0:66,341] The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also  

[8:1:66,351] provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and  

[8:2:66,361] counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices.  

[9:0:66,382] The Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures and  

[9:1:66,392] program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement agencies. It  

[9:2:66,402] also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a clearinghouse of  

[9:3:66,412] successful program information. Finally, it conducts accreditation and peace officer feasibility studies.  

[9:4:66,430] 6505 - TRAINING  

[10:0:66,448] The Training Program increases the competence of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that meet  

[10:1:66,458] identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses, and assisting law enforcement  

[10:2:66,468] agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission assesses  

[10:3:66,478] training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of topics  

[10:4:66,489] necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training needs of  

[10:5:66,499] law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Program also presents advanced training for  

[10:6:66,509] law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership Institute, and for  

[10:7:66,519] trainers through the Basic Academy Instructor Certificate Program and the Instructor Development Institute. Other specialty  

[10:8:66,529] programs include the Institute of Criminal Investigation.  

[11:0:66,547] Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are  

[11:1:66,557] enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards.  

[11:2:66,575] 6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING  

[12:0:66,595] The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs associated  

[12:1:66,606] with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses associated with  

[12:2:66,616] training presentations to enable line officers to receive in-service training in areas of critical need. To encourage and assist local  

[12:3:66,626] law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in the selection and training of law enforcement officers,  

[12:4:66,636] the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, approximately 346 cities, and numerous specialized districts  

[12:5:66,646] and local agencies which have agreed to meet the Commission's standards.  

[12:6:66,664] 6515 - POST ADMINISTRATION  

[13:0:66,685] The   objective of the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training is to be the leading organization in

[0:0:66,13] GENERAL GOVERNMENT   2019-20 STATE BUDGET — GG   17 

[1:0:183,43] 8420   State Compensation Insurance Fund  

[2:0:66,64] State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was originally  

[2:1:66,74] enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing body of a  

[2:2:66,84] private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of directors for  

[2:3:66,95] approval.  

[3:0:66,115] State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore  

[3:1:66,125] injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers located  

[3:2:66,135] in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on policies  

[3:3:66,146] written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, and the  

[3:4:66,156] state is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the California civil  

[3:5:66,166] service process and are actually employees of the state.  

[4:0:66,186] State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the state and  

[4:1:66,197] because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not  

[4:2:66,207] financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund.  

[5:0:66,227] Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation coverage  

[5:1:66,237] and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to private  

[5:2:66,248] employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers'  

[5:3:66,258] compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and  

[5:4:66,268] other subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the state provides a  

[5:5:66,278] deposit out of which State Fund pays compensation benefits to injured state workers and medical benefits to health providers,  

[5:6:66,288] and State Fund is reimbursed by state agencies for benefit amounts paid plus a service fee equal to the cost of these services.  

[6:0:66,309] For informational purposes only, the table further below   provides summary data on actual and estimated workers'  

[6:1:66,319] compensation claims costs paid by state agencies. All workers' compensation costs are included in the individual budgets of  

[6:2:66,329] the responsible state agencies. Costs also include administrative charges under the Master Services Agreement.

[1:0:184,43] 8570   Department of Food and Agriculture  

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Food and Agriculture serves the citizens of California by promoting and protecting a safe, healthy  

[2:1:66,74] food supply, and enhancing local and global agricultural trade, through efficient management, innovation, and sound science,  

[2:2:66,84] with a commitment to environmental stewardship.  

[3:0:66,105] The goals of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are to:  

[3:1:65,123] • Promote and protect the diverse local and global marketability of the California agricultural brand which represents superior  

[3:2:76,133] quality, value, and safety.  

[4:0:65,149] • Optimize resources through collaboration, innovation, and process improvements.  

[5:0:65,165] • Connect rural and urban communities by supporting and participating in educational programs that emphasize a mutual  

[5:1:76,175] appreciation of the value of diverse food and agricultural production systems.  

[5:2:65,192] • Improve regulatory efficiency through proactive coordination with stakeholders.  

[5:3:65,208] • Invest in employee development and succession planning efforts.  

[6:0:66,225] Because the California Department of Food and Agriculture's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the  

[7:0:66,236] Department has a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see

[7:0:66,570] 6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES  

[8:0:66,591] The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and diseases to  

[8:1:66,601] California, promote judicious antimicrobial use and stewardship   and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat  

[8:2:66,611] products exempt from Federal inspection. In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be  

[8:3:66,621] transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, (3)  

[8:4:66,631] have severe negative impact on the environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the consumer.  

[8:5:66,649] 6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES  

[9:0:66,669] California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The  

[9:1:66,680] objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural  

[9:2:66,690] commodities, promote consumer protection, increase food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported  

[9:3:66,700] grading services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the  

[9:4:66,710] marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products.

[5:0:66,243] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,261] 6680 - REGULATION OF UTILITIES 

[7:0:66,279] Californians spend more than $50 billion annually for services from industries regulated by the PUC. This includes 6 electricity  

[7:1:66,289] utilities, 900 telecommunications carriers, 120 water and sewer utilities, 5 natural gas utilities with approximately 10.8 million  

[7:2:66,299] customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home park and propane operators.  

[8:0:66,317] The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions  

[8:1:66,327] include both backward-looking investigation and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk  

[8:2:66,337] assessment to identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC also performs operation and maintenance audits, outage  

[8:3:66,347] inspections, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities.  

[9:0:66,365] The PUC conducts triennial reviews of utility operations to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. The PUC  

[9:1:66,375] provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities—and to a lesser extent, as directed by statute, an increasing number of  

[9:2:66,385] Community Choice Aggregators, Energy Service Providers, and Core Transport Agents—to follow when purchasing electricity  

[9:3:66,396] and natural gas on behalf of their customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and where  

[9:4:66,406] needed in the state.  

[10:0:66,424] Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation. The PUC is charged with  

[10:1:66,434] implementing and overseeing key components of Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015 (SB 350), Chapter 312, Statutes of 2018 (SB  

[10:2:66,444] 100), and other climate change legislation, including promoting ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, Integrated  

[10:3:66,454] Resource Planning, the state's mandated renewable energy programs, programs for disadvantaged communities, electric  

[10:4:66,464] vehicle programs, and other clean energy programs.  

[11:0:66,482] The PUC oversees programs and regulations to promote both natural gas and electricity reliability and resilience.  

[12:0:66,500] The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate  

[12:1:66,510] discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost  

[12:2:66,520] weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria.  

[13:0:66,538] The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for transmission,  

[13:1:66,548] telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects.  

[14:0:66,566] The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including  

[14:1:66,576] monitoring competitive markets for proper operation; enforcing carrier service standards for telecommunication services;  

[14:2:66,586] regulating rural telecommunication rates; protecting consumers against carrier abuses and fraud by applying licensing  

[14:3:66,596] requirements and rules for offering and terminating telecommunication services; and managing efficient deployment of area  

[14:4:66,607] codes and telephone numbers. The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver  

[14:5:66,617] clean, safe, and reliable water to their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water  

[14:6:66,627] and sewer service quality, promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and  

[14:7:66,637] processing rate change requests, and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements.  

[15:0:66,655] The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in  

[15:1:66,665] participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in  

[15:2:66,675] proceedings. The Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB) responds to questions regarding utility service and bills, and assists  

[15:3:66,685] consumers who have unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. CAB also provides data on the  

[15:4:66,696] consumer protection issues it handles to stakeholders and decision makers to inform policy making. A Supplier Diversity  

[15:5:66,706] program promotes and monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse.

[2:0:173,32] 8660   Public Utilities Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] 6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS 

[4:0:66,86] The PUC oversees telecommunication-based universal service programs (California Lifeline Fund, California Teleconnect  

[4:1:66,97] Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, California Advanced Service Fund, and two California High Cost  

[4:2:66,107] Funds), all of which provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these "universal service"  

[4:3:66,117] programs include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) improving access to broadband  

[4:4:66,127] technology to bridge the digital divide; and (3) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make informed  

[4:5:66,137] choices about basic service and universal lifeline telephone services. 

[5:0:66,155] The California LifeLine program provides discounted basic residential wireless and wireline telephone service to qualified low  

[5:1:66,165] income households. The California Teleconnect Fund program provides discounted telecommunication services to qualifying  

[5:2:66,175] schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program mainly  

[5:3:66,186] provides equipment and telephone access services to people with hearing disabilities. The California Advanced Services Fund  

[5:4:66,196] Program mainly encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved rural and urban areas of  

[5:5:66,206] California. The California High Cost Fund programs provide subsidies to carriers obligated to provide telephone service to  

[5:6:66,216] customers residing in rural and high-cost areas.  

[6:0:66,234] 6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 

[7:0:66,252] The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in  

[7:1:66,262] California. All railroads, 7 major rail transit agencies, 6 smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private  

[7:2:66,272] crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-

[7:3:66,282] certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and  

[7:4:66,292] appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of  

[7:5:66,303] hazardous materials by rail.  

[8:0:66,320] For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train control,  

[8:1:66,331] and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or  

[8:2:66,341] disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, as well as crossing safety treatments deployed at each  

[8:3:66,351] crossing. Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing  

[8:4:66,361] hazard elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-

[8:5:66,371] separating highway/rail crossings.  

[9:0:66,389] The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation  

[9:1:66,399] companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, transportation network companies, and charter and scheduled bus operators) and  

[9:2:66,409] privately-owned water ferries. The program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety  

[9:3:66,420] standards and insurance requirements, and protects consumers from for-hire passenger carriers operating illegally.  

[10:0:66,437] 6695 - PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE  

[11:0:66,455] The mandate and function of the Public Advocate's Office is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The Public  

[11:1:66,465] Advocate's Office is a statutorily-defined state entity charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility  

[11:2:66,475] customers and subscribers in all significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction.  

[12:0:66,493] Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the Public Advocate's Office with a director appointed by and serving at the  

[12:1:66,503] pleasure of the Governor and charged the Public Advocate's Office with representing ratepayer interests in PUC proceedings.  

[12:2:66,514] Chapter 1005, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement  

[12:3:66,524] Account to be transferred in the annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account. The law  

[12:4:66,534] further required that "funds in the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account shall be utilized exclusively by  

[12:5:66,544] the division in the performance of its duties as determined by the director" of the Public Advocates Office.  

[13:0:66,562] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that the Public Advocate's Office only represent ratepayers in  

[13:1:66,572] PUC proceedings. SB 201 extended the Public Advocate's Office representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the  

[13:2:66,582] Energy Commission, Air Resources Board, California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.

[1:1:228,57] Organization and Economy  

[1:2:66,78] The Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (Commission) is the  

[1:3:66,89] state's only independent and citizen-based oversight mechanism. It conducts four to five comprehensive reviews of executive  

[1:4:66,99] branch programs, departments, and agencies each year and recommends ways to improve performance by increasing  

[1:5:66,109] efficiency and effectiveness with existing resources. The Commission is statutorily responsible for analyzing and making  

[1:6:66,119] recommendations to the Legislature on all Governor reorganization plans.  

[2:0:66,140] The Commission is composed of two members of the Senate, two members of the Assembly, and nine unpaid citizen members  

[2:1:66,150] - five appointed by the Governor and four appointed by the Legislature.  

[3:0:66,170] Because of the Commission's independence, the Legislature charged it with oversight of the California State Auditor, including  

[3:1:66,180] contracting with an independent auditor for annually examining the State Audit Fund.

[1:0:197,43] 8855   California State Auditor's Office  

[2:0:66,64] The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public funds  

[2:1:66,74] and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of state and  

[2:2:66,84] local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State  

[2:3:66,95] Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity.  

[2:4:66,105] The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by  

[2:5:66,115] the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually  

[2:6:66,125] conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements  

[2:7:66,135] and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a  

[2:8:66,146] condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that  

[2:9:66,156] requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter  

[2:10:66,166] biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which  

[2:11:66,176] includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.  

[3:0:66,197] The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse,  

[3:1:66,207] and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority  

[3:2:66,217] to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter  

[3:3:66,227] 451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local  

[3:4:66,237] government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the  

[4:0:66,248] potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or  

[4:1:66,258] effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities.  

[5:0:66,278] Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform  

[6:0:66,288] independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The  

[6:1:66,299] State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper  

[6:2:66,309] acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law.  

[7:0:66,329] The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an  

[7:1:66,339] application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10  

[7:2:66,350] years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and  

[7:3:66,360] conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

[6:1:66,329] 6770 - STATE BUDGET  

[7:0:66,350] To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance  

[7:1:66,360] advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's Budget  

[7:2:66,370] contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and proposed  

[7:3:66,380] expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of Finance assists in  

[7:4:66,390] the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state agencies and  

[7:5:66,401] programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources,  

[7:6:66,411] and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Basic and  

[7:7:66,421] applied economic and tax research functions support the revenue estimates required for the development of the state financial  

[7:8:66,431] plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the evaluation of economic trends or other fiscal developments which affect  

[7:9:66,441] the state. Basic and applied demographic research functions provide data to support the workload estimates of state agencies.  

[7:10:66,459] 6775 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA (FI$Cal) PROJECT SUPPORT  

[8:0:66,477] The Department of Finance is one of four partner agencies responsible for the development, implementation, utilization, and  

[8:1:66,487] maintenance of an integrated statewide financial management system, FI$Cal. This program includes Department of Finance  

[8:2:66,497] subject-matter experts assigned to the FI$Cal Project.  

[8:3:66,515] 6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS  

[9:0:66,535] The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs. The Office of  

[9:1:66,545] State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all  

[9:2:66,556] matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical  

[9:3:66,566] examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of redevelopment  

[9:4:66,576] agencies.  

[10:0:66,594] 6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING  

[11:0:66,611] The Statewide Accounting Policies, Consulting and Training Unit sets statewide accounting policies and procedures. The unit  

[11:1:66,622] provides fiscal consulting, training, and support services to departments to help ensure that the state's assets are protected  

[11:2:66,632] and accurate, and timely financial information is maintained. The unit maintains a uniform and complete accounting system for  

[11:3:66,642] state departments and participates in the development of other statewide financial systems.

[1:0:164,43] 8880   Financial Information System for California  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of FI$Cal is responsible for supporting the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) Project,  

[3:0:66,74] including supporting the system's customers and stakeholders, onboarding any new, deferred, or exempt entities, as well as  

[4:0:66,84] assuming responsibility for system maintenance, upgrades, and enhancements as portions of the system are implemented and  

[4:1:66,95] accepted.  

[5:0:66,115] The FI$Cal Project is a partnership of four control agencies: the Department of Finance, the State Controller's Office, the State  

[5:1:66,125] Treasurer's Office, and the Department of General Services. FI$Cal will provide the state with a single integrated financial  

[6:0:66,135] management system that encompasses budgeting, accounting, procurement, cash management, and financial management  

[7:0:66,146] and reporting. FI$Cal, through the adoption of best business practices, will: reengineer business processes; improve efficiency;  

[7:1:66,156] enhance decision making and resource management; and provide reliable, accessible, and timely statewide financial  

[8:0:66,166] information allowing the state to be more transparent.   FI$Cal further enables transparency through its Open FI$Cal website,  

[8:1:66,176] which was implemented in 2018 pursuant to Government Code section 11862.   Although Open FI$Cal is currently in its pilot  

[9:0:66,186] form, the website will continue to expand providing the public with access to a growing number of the state's non-confidential  

[9:1:66,197] expenditures.

[1:0:231,43] 8940   Military Department  

[2:0:66,64] The Military Department is responsible for the command, leadership and management of the California National Guard, Youth  

[2:1:66,74] and Community Programs, State Military Reserve and the Naval Militia. The California Military Department, under proper  

[2:2:66,84] authority, organizes, resources, and trains forces with unique capabilities to serve the community, state, and nation. The  

[2:3:66,95] purpose of the California National Guard is to provide mission ready forces to the federal government as directed by the  

[2:4:66,105] President, emergency public safety support to civil authorities as directed by the Governor, and support to our member's  

[2:5:66,115] families and to the community. With an authorized strength of 22,325, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are  

[2:6:66,125] organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance.  

[3:0:66,146] The Military Department Youth and Community Program serves California communities and families by delivering national  

[3:1:66,156] level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic  

[3:2:66,166] structured environment. In addition to the funding that flows through the State Treasury, the Military Department also receives  

[3:3:66,176] federal funding directly from the Department of Defense. A special display titled "Other Federal Funds" shows the funding  

[3:4:66,186] received from this source.  

[4:0:66,207] Because the Military Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay  

[4:1:66,217] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:446,13] GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[2:0:196,32] 8940   Military Department - Continued 

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,94] 6911 - NATIONAL GUARD  

[5:0:66,115] The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our  

[5:1:66,125] State Military Reserve. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications,  

[5:2:66,135] law enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and  

[5:3:66,145] unmanned aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant  

[5:4:66,156] General element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal  

[5:5:66,166] resource management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil  

[5:6:66,176] Support element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and  

[5:7:66,186] unity of purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the  

[5:8:66,196] deployment of Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the  

[5:9:66,207] Governor due to domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with  

[5:10:66,217] the coordination necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Military Reserve is a volunteer component of the  

[5:11:66,227] Military Department whose mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for  

[5:12:66,237] mobilization, demobilization, and provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal  

[5:13:66,247] government provides virtually all supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training,  

[5:14:66,258] deployment, and commitment of the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and  

[5:15:66,268] Air Force Regulations and Training Guidance.  

[6:0:66,286] 6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS  

[7:0:66,303] The Military Department manages and maintains partnerships with the following nine programs while serving more than 13,000  

[7:1:66,313] youth annually: California Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, Porterville Military Academy,  

[7:2:66,324] Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, STARBASE Academy Sacramento and  

[7:3:66,334] STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by the California Legislature and then-

[7:4:66,344] Adjutant General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is designed to provide maximum  

[7:5:66,354] growth and leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It provides leadership opportunities  

[7:6:66,364] for cadets by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their cadet military units, and by  

[8:0:66,375] demonstrating proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of their training, cadets provide  

[8:1:66,385] assistance and support to the school and community. The Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, and Porterville  

[8:2:66,395] Military Academy develops leaders of character by providing rigorous programs to promote excellence in academics,  

[9:0:66,405] leadership, citizenship, athletics, and physical fitness/well being. Additionally, the programs instill the 10 Cadet Corps values of  

[9:1:66,415] loyalty, education, ambition, duty, enthusiasm, respect, service, health, integrity, and personal courage. Using a military  

[10:0:66,426] framework, these programs graduate cadets who are capable of meeting the admissions requirements for college and who are  

[10:1:66,436] prepared for their roles as future leaders. The mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and  

[10:2:66,446] reclaim the lives of 16-18 year old high school dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and  

[10:3:66,456] self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens. The goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to  

[10:4:66,466] motivate elementary school students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as  

[10:5:66,477] they continue their education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their  

[10:6:66,487] understanding of the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of  

[10:7:66,497] STEM activities more attractive and accessible. While attending STARBASE students interact with military personnel to explore  

[10:8:66,507] careers and observe STEM applications in the "real world." These nine youth programs are financed with federal, state and  

[10:9:66,517] local funds. The California National Guard is involved in youth programs because political and community leaders at the  

[10:10:66,528] federal, state, and local levels recognize that the National Guard brings structure, discipline, and effective leadership training  

[10:11:66,538] methods to the educational setting.

[0:0:66,13] 2019-20 STATE BUDGET — GG   128   GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[1:0:199,43] 8955   Department of Veterans Affairs  

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring  

[2:1:66,74] our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. The CalVet promotes and  

[2:2:66,84] delivers innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners.  

[3:0:66,105] More specifically, the CalVet:  

[3:1:65,123] • Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to  

[3:2:76,133] educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits.  

[4:0:65,149] • Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits  

[4:1:76,159] before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals.  

[5:0:65,175] • Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans  

[5:1:76,186] to acquire farms and homes.  

[6:0:65,202] • Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a  

[6:1:76,212] home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes.  

[7:0:66,240] This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public  

[8:0:66,250] purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment  

[8:1:66,260] assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to  

[8:2:66,270] military service.  

[9:0:66,291] Because the CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[9:1:66,301] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:224,32] 9100   Tax Relief - Continued 

[3:0:66,88] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,106] 7500 - HOMEOWNERS' PROPERTY TAX RELIEF  

[4:0:66,127] In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying  

[4:1:66,137] property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the state  

[4:2:66,147] to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption.  

[4:3:66,165] 7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE  

[5:0:66,182] The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural,  

[5:1:66,193] scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, Section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to  

[5:2:66,203] be assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties to  

[5:3:66,213] partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program.  

[5:4:66,231] 7510 - SENIOR CITIZENS' PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT LOAN REPAYMENTS  

[5:5:66,248] The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program allows eligible homeowners to defer payment of residential property  

[5:6:66,259] tax. The state pays the deferred taxes to local governments on behalf of the participants, and places a lien on their property to  

[5:7:66,269] assure repayment when the property is sold or transferred. The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Loan Repayments  

[5:8:66,279] Program captures repayments from individuals that participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program  

[5:9:66,289] and transfers to the General Fund the amount in excess of what is required to fund the Postponement Program claims. The  

[5:10:66,299] Program was suspended in 2009 and was reestablished via legislation in 2014 (Chapter 703, Statutes of 2014).  

[5:11:66,317] 7515 - RECALL ELECTIONS  

[6:0:66,335] Recall Elections provides funding for counties to pay for the costs of state recall elections in 2018, including expenses for  

[6:1:66,345] verifying signatures, printing ballots and voter information guides, and operating polling places in accordance with section  

[6:2:66,355] 11108 of the Elections Code.  

[6:3:66,373] 7520 - LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESS PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,391] The Local Update of Census Address Program provides population-based incentive grants of between $7,500 and $125,000 to  

[7:1:66,401] cities and counties, to ensure they participate in the review and update of the United States Census Bureau's Master Address  

[7:2:66,411] List for the 2020 Census.

[1:4:66,95] Tobacco Settlement Revenue backed bonds, it is not anticipated that the General Fund will be required to make any payments.

[1:0:171,43] 9620   Cash Management and Budgetary Loans  

[2:0:66,64] The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash flow  

[2:1:66,74] and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow imbalances  

[2:2:66,84] during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the General Fund may  

[2:3:66,95] need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. Budgetary loans may be used to loan monies from various state funds to  

[2:4:66,105] the General Fund to help bridge a budget shortfall. These loans are temporary, and do not harm the operations of departmental  

[2:5:66,115] programs.

[11:1:66,563] 7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,584] Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities  

[13:0:66,604] Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to as  

[13:1:66,614] "borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in slightly  

[13:2:66,624] modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables the  

[13:3:66,635] General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these funds'  

[13:4:66,645] money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not interfere  

[13:5:66,655] with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a fund is  

[13:6:66,665] designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State Controller's  

[13:7:66,675] Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund cash  

[13:8:66,686] shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire cash  

[13:9:66,696] balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes.

[2:0:136,32] 9620   Cash Management and Budgetary Loans - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79,  

[3:1:66,79] Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state entity  

[3:2:66,89] that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 million  

[3:3:66,99] and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in this  

[3:4:66,109] Program.  

[4:0:66,130] A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, Government  

[4:1:66,140] Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity for  

[4:2:66,150] the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the maximum amount for the VIP  

[4:3:66,160] from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this Program.  

[5:0:66,191] Borrowing From Financial Markets  

[6:0:66,211] In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this doctrine,  

[6:1:66,222] an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 1 of Article  

[6:2:66,232] XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This doctrine was  

[6:3:66,242] invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and again in 1971 to  

[6:4:66,252] validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions were invoked in  

[6:5:66,262] 1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like registered warrants,  

[6:6:66,273] required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes provisions were re-

[6:7:66,283] enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84.  

[7:0:66,303] In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided the  

[7:1:66,313] flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external funds  

[7:2:66,324] results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which the  

[7:3:66,334] General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code.  

[8:0:66,354] External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation warrants  

[8:1:66,364] (RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in anticipation of  

[8:2:66,375] receiving revenues in the near future.  

[9:0:66,395] Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any  

[9:1:66,405] other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow.  

[10:0:66,436] Overall Program  

[11:0:66,456] Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for the  

[11:1:66,466] past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts nor  

[11:2:66,477] disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. To reflect cash flow, budget data is  

[11:3:66,487] converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the Controller and for  

[11:4:66,497] accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and administrative actions.  

[12:0:66,517] The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and  

[12:1:66,528] assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used  

[12:2:66,538] from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year.  

[13:0:66,556] 7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS  

[14:0:66,573] The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are repaid over  

[14:1:66,583] multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are repaid with interest calculated at the Pooled Money  

[14:2:66,594] Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

[1:0:157,43] 9625   Interest Payments to the Federal Government  

[2:0:66,64] Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal  

[2:1:66,74] government. The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds between  

[2:2:66,84] the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely fund  

[2:3:66,95] disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds in the  

[2:4:66,105] state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal government  

[2:5:66,115] from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state account; and (d) the  

[2:6:66,125] federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the state account until the  

[2:7:66,135] funds are paid out for program purposes.  

[3:0:66,156] The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $295 million or more in federal fund  

[3:1:66,166] expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e.,  

[3:2:66,176] check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be  

[3:3:66,186] deposited before the warrants are issued.  

[4:0:66,207] Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest  

[4:1:66,217] liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

[1:0:168,43] 9650   Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants  

[2:0:66,64] This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents.  

[3:0:66,84] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan.  

[3:1:66,95] Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was added  

[3:2:66,105] in 1982.  

[4:0:66,125] The 2018-19 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016,  

[4:1:66,135] maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested  

[4:2:66,146] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment  

[4:3:66,156] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90  

[4:4:66,166] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer  

[4:5:66,176] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.  

[5:0:66,197] The 2018-19 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and after January 1, 2017,  

[5:1:66,207] maintains the average 80/80 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871.3 for fully vested  

[5:2:66,217] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment  

[5:3:66,227] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 80  

[5:4:66,237] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer  

[5:5:66,248] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.  

[6:0:66,268] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[6:1:66,278] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2018 monthly contribution  

[6:2:66,288] maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or  

[6:3:66,299] more dependents. The 2019 monthly contribution maximums are $734 for a single enrollee, $1,398 for an enrollee and one  

[6:4:66,309] dependent, and $1,788 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan and number of  

[6:5:66,319] dependents.  

[7:0:66,339] Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code  

[7:1:66,350] 6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

[1:0:204,43] 9658   Budget Stabilization Account  

[2:0:66,64] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization  

[2:1:66,74] Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. Proposition 2 strengthened  

[2:2:66,84] the reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the  

[2:3:66,95] BSA, and increasing the reserve limit.  

[3:0:66,115] Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers  

[3:1:66,125] between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a calculated  

[3:2:66,135] amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities.  

[4:0:66,162] LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY  

[5:0:66,180] PROGRAM AUTHORITY  

[6:0:66,201] Section 20, Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California.  

[6:1:66,211] Control Section 35.50, Budget Act.  

[7:0:66,229] Item 9658-011-0001, 2016 Budget Act and 2018 Budget Act.  

[8:0:66,249] Item 9658-012-1022, 2018 Budget Act and Government Code Section 16418.8.  

[9:0:66,286] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:66,304] 7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy day"  

[10:1:66,315] 50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital gains over 8  

[10:2:66,325] percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 percent to pay  

[10:3:66,335] down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy day," reduced by  

[10:4:66,345] any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance in the BSA is limited to  

[10:5:66,355] 10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes for the fiscal year. Any amounts in excess of ten percent may only be used for  

[10:6:66,366] infrastructure needs.  

[11:0:66,386] Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years.  

[12:0:66,406] The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds  

[12:1:66,417] from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for

[13:0:66,447] Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will

[11:0:66,569] This program includes all claims approved by the three-member California Victim Compensation Board and the Government  

[11:1:66,580] Claims Program under the Department of General Services, and referred to the Legislature in the omnibus claims bills for  

[11:2:66,590] payment. The program provides an equitable procedure for the payment of the following categories of claims:  

[11:3:65,607] • Claims for which no appropriation has been made or for which no fund is available, but the settlement of which has been  

[11:4:76,618] provided for by statute or constitutional provision.  

[12:0:65,634] • Claims for which the appropriation made or fund designated is exhausted.  

[13:0:65,650] • Claims for which settlement is not otherwise provided for by statute or constitutional provision.  

[14:0:66,668] The Government Claims Program was transferred to the Department of General Services from the former California Victim  

[14:1:66,678] Compensation and Government Claims Board in July 2016. The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims  

[14:2:66,688] Board became the California Victim Compensation Board.

[1:0:164,43] 9800   Augmentation for Employee Compensation  

[2:0:66,64] This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated money,  

[2:1:66,74] through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the funding for  

[2:2:66,84] those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet appropriated by the  

[2:3:66,95] Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item.  

[3:0:66,115] Additionally, this item sets aside funding for penalties the state may face under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Beginning in  

[3:1:66,125] 2015, the state became subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provision of the ACA. This provision requires large  

[3:2:66,135] employers to offer health benefits to full-time employees, defined as those who work on average 130 or more hours per month  

[3:3:66,146] (or 30 hours per week), and their dependent children. Under this provision, the state may be subject to penalties (Part B  

[3:4:66,156] Penalty), which may include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that may have been considered full-time for one or  

[3:5:66,166] more months, were not offered or did not qualify for health benefits through the state, purchased health coverage from the  

[3:6:66,176] Health Insurance Marketplace (known as Covered California), and received a premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction.  

[4:0:66,197] The ACA also contains reporting requirements, which require the state to track specified ACA-related employee information on  

[4:1:66,207] a monthly basis to identify the employees who meet health eligibility requirements, document whether benefits were offered,  

[4:2:66,217] and whether the employee accepted benefits. This data collection is used to report the state's level of ACA compliance to the  

[4:3:66,227] Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. The state may be assessed penalties for inaccurate reporting (Internal Revenue  

[4:4:66,237] Code sections 6721 and 6722).

[1:0:207,43] 9818   Federal Levy of State Funds  

[1:1:66,64] The federal courts periodically issue judgments or "writs of execution" against the State of California requiring the state to make  

[1:2:66,74] payments to the federal government. The writs and judgments provide the authority to the federal government to withdraw  

[1:3:66,84] funds from the state bank accounts maintained by the State Treasurer's Office at the various state depository banks.  

[1:4:66,105] Each year, the Budget Act authorizes the Department of Finance to identify specific appropriations or funds to charge when the  

[1:5:66,115] federal government withdraws funds from state bank accounts. When no specific appropriation or fund can be identified, the  

[1:6:66,125] withdrawals are charged to the unappropriated General Fund balance.  

[2:0:66,146] No levies were paid during the 2017-18 fiscal year and none have been paid through June 15, 2019.

[1:0:168,43] 9885   Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances  

[2:0:66,64] For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not yet  

[2:1:66,74] been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure totals.  

[2:2:66,84] This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department budgets.  

[3:0:66,105] For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that  

[4:0:66,115] encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore,  

[4:1:66,125] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General  

[4:2:66,135] Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and state  

[4:3:66,146] policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide adjustment  

[4:4:66,156] to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government Code Section  

[4:5:66,166] 13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary Schedule 1 for the  

[4:6:66,176] General Fund.  

[5:0:66,197] COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT  

[6:0:66,217] The State Controller's Office accumulated a preliminary estimated General Fund encumbrance total of $1,384,512,000 from  

[6:1:66,227] 2017-18 year-end financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are estimated  

[6:2:66,237] to be at the same level for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within the next fiscal  

[6:3:66,248] year. The Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the encumbrance adjustment.

[1:1:66,64] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2017, established the Public School System Stabilization Account (PSSSA) as  

[1:2:66,74] a ”rainy day“ reserve for K-14 schools.  

[2:0:66,92] Proposition 2 requires Proposition 98 General Fund deposits into or withdrawals from the fund each year, as well as two  

[2:1:66,102] preceding fiscal years, when specific criteria are met.   Calculation of a deposit or withdrawal from the   PSSSA does not change

[1:0:122,43] 9900   Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata)  

[2:0:66,64] Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide  

[3:0:66,74] budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments. The Pro Rata process apportions  

[3:1:66,84] the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit from the  

[4:0:66,95] services. Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are transferred from  

[4:1:66,105] the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund.  

[5:0:66,125] Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata charges to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets. This  

[5:1:66,135] budget item included Pro Rata costs directly charged to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not  

[6:0:66,146] provided for in departmental budgets. Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata costs charged directly at the fund  

[6:1:66,156] level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
