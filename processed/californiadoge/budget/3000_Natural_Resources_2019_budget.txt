[8:0:66,332] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and  

[8:1:66,342] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops  

[8:2:66,353] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.  

[9:0:66,373] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological  

[9:1:66,383] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,  

[9:2:66,393] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary  

[9:3:66,404] home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its  

[9:4:66,414] permanent home - is completed.  

[10:0:66,434] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The  

[10:1:66,444] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and  

[10:2:66,455] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a

[1:0:201,43] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy  

[2:0:66,64] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the extraordinary natural and  

[2:1:66,74] recreational resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and  

[2:2:66,84] implementing programs that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and  

[2:3:66,95] watershed restoration, and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy  

[2:4:66,105] also balances these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally  

[2:5:66,115] sound manner by acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.  

[3:0:66,135] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is intended to  

[3:1:66,146] restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.   The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the  

[3:2:66,156] Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed  

[3:3:66,166] to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[3:4:66,176] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 

[4:0:66,197] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program  

[4:1:66,207] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[9:0:66,564] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:1:66,583] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY  

[10:0:66,600] The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 parcels totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-acre  

[10:1:66,610] lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have  

[10:2:66,621] significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits  

[10:3:66,631] and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments.  

[10:4:66,641] Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the  

[10:5:66,651] Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities,  

[10:6:66,661] including six beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe.  

[11:0:66,679] The Conservancy and its partners are also increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects  

[11:1:66,689] to more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. Working at a landscape scale makes it easier for  

[11:2:66,700] the Conservancy and its partners to integrate the planning for and management of multiple values and resources across  

[11:3:66,710] jurisdictions. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of

[2:0:166,32] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving  

[3:1:66,79] forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire, clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank  

[3:2:66,89] erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to  

[3:3:66,99] wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change. This evolution in the Conservancy’s approach to planning also aligns it with  

[3:4:66,109] national and statewide trends toward restoring landscape resilience.  

[4:0:66,127] The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site  

[4:1:66,137] improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating  

[4:2:66,148] public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake.  

[4:3:66,165] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  

[5:0:66,186] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing  

[5:1:66,196] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide  

[5:2:66,206] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds  

[5:3:66,216] such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.  

[6:0:66,234] In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting  

[6:1:66,244] urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive  

[6:2:66,254] Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town  

[6:3:66,265] center objectives.   Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other  

[6:4:66,275] environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

[12:3:66,550] 1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local  

[12:4:66,560] governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[12:5:66,570] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

[2:0:66,64] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires,  

[2:1:66,74] floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at  

[2:2:66,84] public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become  

[2:3:66,95] strong workers and citizens.  

[3:0:66,115] In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that  

[3:1:66,125] are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities.  

[4:0:66,146] Because the   CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this

[13:1:66,636] facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training,  

[13:2:66,646] and educational opportunities to young men and women. The facilities are also critical in the CCC assisting federal, state and  

[13:3:66,656] local agencies, as well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources.  

[13:4:66,674] The CCC residential facilities house 80-100 corpsmembers and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people together from  

[13:5:66,684] across the state, increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential centers range in size  

[13:6:66,695] from 30-60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

[2:0:171,32] 3480   Department of Conservation - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] 2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION  

[4:0:66,89] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,  

[4:1:66,99] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and  

[4:2:66,109] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,  

[4:3:66,120] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about  

[4:4:66,130] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.  

[4:5:66,148] 2425 - OIL, GAS, AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES  

[5:0:66,165] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to protect the  

[5:1:66,175] environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety. The state is fully reimbursed for program expenditures by annual  

[5:2:66,186] assessments and fees on the respective industries. Approximately 450 companies operate over 88,000 wells in California for  

[5:3:66,196] the production of oil, natural gas, and geothermal resources.  

[5:4:66,214] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION  

[6:0:66,231] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. Under the Land Conservation  

[6:1:66,241] Act, landowners who agree to keep their property undeveloped for at least ten years receive lower property tax assessments.  

[6:2:66,252] The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts for the  

[6:3:66,262] acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development rights, and therefore development  

[6:4:66,272] pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program within the Land Resource Protection  

[6:5:66,282] Program develops maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to  

[6:6:66,292] assist in local land use decisions.  

[6:7:66,310] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION  

[7:0:66,328] This program regulates active surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the  

[7:1:66,338] Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to  

[7:2:66,348] reclaim mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned  

[7:3:66,358] mines and remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.  

[7:4:66,376] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD  

[8:0:66,394] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of  

[8:1:66,404] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The Department's California Geological Survey and the Office of Mine  

[8:2:66,414] Reclamation provide the engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for the reports, plans, and maps which the  

[8:3:66,424] Board approves. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notices of violations  

[8:4:66,435] or orders to comply, and disputes with local lead agencies.

[1:0:164,43] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the  

[2:1:66,74] property and resources of California.  

[3:0:66,95] CAL FIRE provides all hazard emergency - fire, medical, rescue and disaster - response to the public and provides leadership  

[3:1:66,105] in the protection of life, property and natural resources.  

[4:0:66,125] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety  

[5:0:66,135] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information & education; resource protection; and emergency response.  

[6:0:66,156] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing  

[6:1:66,166] diverse yet complementary efforts including: training California's fire service professionals; public education and prevention  

[6:2:66,176] awareness; responsible stewardship of our natural resources; and natural resource and emergency management.  

[7:0:66,197] CAL FIRE's highly trained professionals and leaders cultivate mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels  

[7:1:66,207] of government and the private sector to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate  

[7:2:66,217] emergencies in the urban, rural, and wild land areas of California.  

[8:0:66,237] CAL FIRE promotes a culture of innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, planning, workplace safety, and teamwork to  

[8:1:66,248] foster an efficient and effective organizational environment.  

[9:0:66,268] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support  

[9:1:66,278] this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[16:0:66,509] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[17:0:65,527] • Increasing Fire Prevention—$224.3 million from various funds to (1) complete more fuel reduction projects through the  

[17:1:76,537] operation of prescribed fire crews and grants for forest health projects; (2) implement the recently enacted wildfire prevention  

[17:2:76,547] and recovery legislative package, which streamlines regulatory barriers for fuel reduction projects; (3) support the Board of  

[17:3:76,558] Forestry and Fire Protection in certifying the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report for the California Vegetation  

[17:4:76,568] Treatment Program; (4) enhance land use plannning and wildfire risk reduction efforts in the wildland urban interface; and  

[17:5:76,578] (5) dispose of illegal and dangerous fireworks.  

[18:0:65,594] • Expanding Firefighting Surge Capacity—$64.4 million General Fund to enhance CAL FIRE's fire protection capabilities,  

[18:1:76,604] including resources to (1) add 13 new year-round fire engines that will be located in areas of the state with the highest fire  

[18:2:76,615] risk, (2) expand heavy fire equipment operator staffing to support CAL FIRE’s bulldozer operations during emergency wildfire  

[18:3:76,625] events, (3) accelerate the replacement of fire engines and other mobile equipment to address increased wear and tear on  

[18:4:76,635] CAL FIRE’s vehicles resulting from the longer fire season, and (4) operate five additional CAL FIRE/California Conservation  

[18:5:76,645] Corps fire crews.  

[19:0:65,661] • Enhancing Aviation Resources—$127.2 million General Fund to add aircraft with increased tactical capabilities to  

[19:1:76,672] CAL FIRE’s aviation fleet to meet the challenges associated with more severe wildfire activity. Specifically, the Budget  

[19:2:76,682] includes $17.7 million General Fund for the first year of operating the large air tankers that will be transferred from the  

[19:3:76,692] U.S. Air Force. Federal legislation authorized the transfer of seven C-130 air tankers to CAL FIRE, and the Budget assumes  

[19:4:76,702] that one to two planes will be transferred each year beginning in 2019-20. The Budget also includes $109.5 million  

[20:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:1:65,85] • Supporting our Emergency Responders—$6.6 million from various funds to expand CAL FIRE’s health and wellness  

[3:2:76,95] program and to provide medical and psychological services, as well as peer support, to firefighters. Catastrophic wildfires are  

[3:3:76,105] creating an environment where first responders are working longer hours and days to mitigate these incidents, while also  

[3:4:76,115] focusing on evacuations in the early hours of fires to get citizens safely out of harm’s way. Personnel are CAL FIRE’s most  

[3:5:76,126] valuable asset, and maintaining their long-term health and well-being allows them to be ready for the next emergency.  

[3:6:65,142] • Improving Use of Technology—$24.7 million General Fund to enable CAL FIRE to (1) procure innovation solutions to combat  

[3:7:76,152] the state's wildfire crisis, consistent with Executive Order N-04-19, by utilizing a modified procurement process referred to as  

[3:8:76,162] the Innovation Procurement Sprint through which CAL FIRE will work collaboratively with vendors to identify, develop, and  

[3:9:76,172] deploy new and innovative solutions; (2) hire dedicated staff to review data gathered via remote sensing technology,  

[3:10:76,183] situational awareness software, and satellite imagery, which will support CAL FIRE’s incident command  

[3:11:76,193] decision-making; and (3) operate 100 additional fire detection cameras that will be linked into the existing command centers  

[3:12:76,203] to provide additional data on conditions.

[3:0:66,69] done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of fire fighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters  

[3:1:66,79] and damage to the environment.  

[4:0:66,97] 2465019 - Fire Control:  

[5:0:66,107] The objective of this program is to detect, respond and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility Area.  

[5:1:66,117] The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to  

[5:2:66,127] 10 acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews,  

[5:3:66,137] bulldozers, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.  

[6:0:66,155] 2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection:  

[7:0:66,173] CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state and federal agencies throughout California  

[7:1:66,183] through the administration of over 100 cooperative government agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing  

[7:2:66,193] agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department.  

[8:0:66,211] 2465037 - Conservation Camps:  

[9:0:66,231] CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Operations and Juvenile  

[9:1:66,241] Justice, operates 39 conservation camps throughout the state that house 196 fire crews. CAL FIRE also operates three Fire  

[9:2:66,252] Centers with the California Conservation Corps (CCC) throughout the state that house seven fire crews. These crews provide  

[9:3:66,262] one of the primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency response, and conservation related work projects.  

[10:0:66,280] 2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression:  

[11:0:66,297] CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope  

[11:1:66,307] with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was  

[11:2:66,318] incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management  

[11:3:66,328] Agency (FEMA) or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of  

[11:4:66,338] this cost through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes.  

[12:0:66,356] 2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  

[13:0:66,373] California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands and urban forests provide multiple human, climate and  

[13:1:66,384] environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to  

[13:2:66,394] these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting,  

[13:3:66,404] coordination of climate related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial landowners, operation of  

[13:4:66,414] state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects and administration of federal  

[13:5:66,424] forestry assistance programs.  

[14:0:66,442] 2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement:  

[15:0:66,452] The objective of this program is to improve forest lands and urban forests. Activities include the detection, evaluation and  

[15:1:66,463] control of forest pests; growing and selling tree seedlings for reforestation, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion control;  

[15:2:66,473] maintenance of a native conifer seed bank; advice and assistance to non-industrial forest landowners on management of  

[15:3:66,483] forests and improved harvesting and conservation practices; research on and demonstration of sustainable forestry in state  

[15:4:66,493] forests; implementation of the California Forest Improvement Act of 1978; technical assistance and grants to foster the  

[15:5:66,503] environmental, social, and economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; and  

[15:6:66,514] purchase and monitoring of working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008. In the area of  

[15:7:66,524] vegetation management, assistance is provided to public and private landowners to achieve land use objectives by reducing  

[15:8:66,534] damage from wildland fires, increase wildlife habitat, increase productivity of forest and rangelands, improve water yields and  

[15:9:66,544] air quality, reduce carbon emissions from wildland fires, increase firefighter safety, and maintain desirable ecosystems.  

[15:10:66,554] CAL FIRE cooperates with federal, state and local agencies, local organizations, and private property owners to develop and  

[15:11:66,565] achieve land use objectives. Activities include removal, rearrangement, conversion, or improvement of vegetation using various  

[15:12:66,575] treatment measures such as prescribed fire and mechanical, manual, and biological methods. The Environmental Protection  

[15:13:66,585] Program provides in-house expertise and oversight of the Department's compliance with the California Environmental Quality  

[15:14:66,595] Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and regulations applicable to departmental actions.  

[16:0:66,613] 2470019 - Forest Practice Regulations:  

[17:0:66,631] The objective of this program is to maximize sustained production of high-quality timber products while protecting soil, water,  

[17:1:66,641] wildlife, recreation and other values associated with forest land. Forest Practice activities include the review and permitting of  

[17:2:66,651] commercial timber harvesting operations on nonfederal timberlands, enforcing state forest practice laws and regulations, and

[1:0:215,43] 3560   State Lands Commission  

[2:0:66,64] The California State Lands Commission provides the people of California with effective stewardship of the lands, waterways,  

[2:1:66,74] and resources entrusted to its care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and  

[2:2:66,84] the promotion of public access. Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted  

[2:3:66,95] in the generation of over $11.6 billion in revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those lands and  

[2:4:66,105] resources.  

[3:0:66,123] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands  

[3:1:66,133] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and resources,  

[3:2:66,143] which the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently conveyed to the  

[3:3:66,153] state by the federal government (commonly known as "school" lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands  

[3:4:66,163] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of the state's  

[3:5:66,174] tidelands, consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced from the  

[3:6:66,184] granted lands back into the trust.  

[4:0:66,201] Public trust or "sovereign" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and  

[4:1:66,212] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean high  

[4:2:66,222] tide line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to sovereign lands,  

[4:3:66,232] the Commission manages "school" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government under the Act of March  

[4:4:66,242] 3, 1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands include the 16th and 36th  

[4:5:66,252] sections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or previously taken by private claims)  

[4:6:66,263] and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state,  

[4:7:66,273] only about 458,843 acres remain in state ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The  

[4:8:66,283] Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

[12:1:66,526] 2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  

[13:0:66,547] The California State Lands Commission oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources that are located on state  

[13:1:66,557] lands. The State also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oils fields, and as such, the Commission participates  

[13:2:66,567] in the safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,  

[13:3:66,577] geothermal resources and other minerals; collect revenues generated consistent with the best interests of the state; and ensure  

[13:4:66,587] that public safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these  

[13:5:66,598] resources through engineering review, marine facility inspections, and safety audits. The Commission also adopts regulations  

[13:6:66,608] for the prevention of oil spills, the safe operation of offshore facilities and program and financial audits to ensure the state  

[13:7:66,618] receives fair value for the development of its resources.  

[13:8:66,636] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT  

[14:0:66,656] The California State Lands Commission manages all ungranted state sovereign lands consistent with the common law public  

[14:1:66,666] trust doctrine and prudent land use and management practices. The Commission issues leases and permits for the use and  

[14:2:66,677] occupation of public trust lands under its jurisdiction based upon environmental, economic, health, safety and public benefit  

[14:3:66,687] considerations. The program also manages all state school lands to ensure the greatest economic return to the California   State  

[14:4:66,697] Teachers' Retirement System. The Commission also oversees the administration of public trust lands legislatively granted to  

[14:5:66,707] local jurisdictions to manage on behalf of the State, including the major ports in the State.

[4:0:66,89] The California   State Lands Commission adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within California,  

[4:1:66,99] providing the best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Commission's Marine  

[4:2:66,109] Environmental Protection Program monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities, and reviews  

[4:3:66,120] and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification programs. The Program also administers  

[4:4:66,130] Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for purpose. In addition, the Marine  

[4:5:66,140] Environmental Protection Program implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of non-

[4:6:66,150] indigenous species into California waters through vessel mediated vectors. The program funds and conducts scientific  

[4:7:66,160] research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing  

[4:8:66,171] vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions.

[1:0:197,43] 3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife  

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the  

[2:1:66,74] habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public.  

[3:0:66,95] This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to ensure the survival of all species and  

[3:1:66,105] natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational,  

[3:2:66,115] commercial, scientific, and educational uses.  

[4:0:66,135] Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[4:1:66,146] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[4:2:66,156] Overview."

[12:0:66,563] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[13:0:66,581] The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages 742 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres (approximately  

[13:1:66,592] 679,000 acres of state-owned land and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the Department. Several state  

[13:2:66,602] agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management responsibilities for these properties  

[13:3:66,612] are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department control continues to increase. The  

[13:4:66,622] properties managed by the Department include: 111 wildlife areas, 136 ecological reserves, 138 public access areas, and 21  

[13:5:66,632] fish hatcheries.

[1:0:198,43] 3720   California Coastal Commission  

[2:0:66,64] The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed equally by the Governor, the Senate Rules  

[2:1:66,74] Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the  

[3:0:66,84] California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and  

[3:1:66,95] recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources,  

[3:2:66,105] and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. New development in the coastal zone requires  

[3:3:66,115] a coastal permit either from local government or the Commission. Local governments are required to prepare a local coastal  

[3:4:66,125] program (LCP) for the coastal zone portion of their jurisdiction. After an LCP has been reviewed and approved by the  

[3:5:66,135] Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act, the Commission's regulatory authority over most types of new  

[4:0:66,146] development is delegated to the local government, subject to limited appeals to the Commission. The Commission also is  

[4:1:66,156] designated the principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone  

[5:0:66,166] Management Act in California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal  

[5:1:66,176] development projects, and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be  

[5:2:66,186] subject to state control.

[4:2:76,117] and around San Francisco Bay.  

[5:0:65,133] • Increase public access to the coast and outdoor recreational opportunities by creating new parks, trails and recreational  

[5:1:76,143] amenities.  

[6:0:65,160] • Prepare for and reduce the unavoidable impacts of climate change on the coastal region and San Francisco Bay Area.  

[6:1:65,176] • Support education programs about coastal resources for kindergarten through grade 12.  

[6:2:65,192] • Facilitate improvement of existing, and the development of new, lower cost accommodations within one and one-half miles of

[1:0:183,43] 3790   Department of Parks and Recreation  

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and  

[3:0:66,74] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most  

[3:1:66,84] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and  

[3:2:66,95] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the  

[3:3:66,105] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural  

[3:4:66,115] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park  

[3:5:66,125] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and  

[3:6:66,135] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,  

[3:7:66,146] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,  

[3:8:66,156] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing  

[3:9:66,166] financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.  

[4:0:66,186] Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need.  

[4:1:66,197] For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:104,43] 3820   San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission  

[2:0:66,64] The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional  

[2:1:66,74] authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance San Francisco Bay and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive use  

[2:2:66,84] for this and future generations. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan and relies on it, the  

[3:0:66,95] McAteer-Petris Act, and other regulatory authority to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission  

[3:1:66,105] issues permits for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and  

[3:2:66,115] certain managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977.  

[3:3:66,125] By state statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay  

[3:4:66,135] and exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The Commission leads the ongoing multi-

[3:5:66,146] agency regional effort to address the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on the Bay and its environs. Funding for  

[3:6:66,156] these efforts to address climate change is derived mainly from federal grants and other agreements, contracts, and  

[3:7:66,166] reimbursements.

[1:0:196,43] 3860   Department of Water Resources  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department  

[3:0:66,74] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs and explores future potential solutions to meet ever-growing  

[3:1:66,84] needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to  

[3:2:66,95] prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its  

[3:3:66,105] efficient use.  

[4:0:66,125] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[4:1:66,135] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,337] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,355] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN  

[7:0:66,376] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water  

[7:1:66,386] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to  

[7:2:66,396] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water  

[7:3:66,406] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water  

[7:4:66,416] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan  

[7:5:66,427] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,  

[7:6:66,437] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,  

[7:7:66,447] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected  

[7:8:66,457] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare  

[7:9:66,467] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure  

[7:10:66,478] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,  

[7:11:66,488] protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water Element for their  

[7:12:66,498] General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local agencies and  

[7:13:66,508] tribal governments improve coordination between water and land use planning.  

[8:0:66,526] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM  

[9:0:66,544] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21  

[9:1:66,554] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,  

[9:2:66,564] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.  

[10:0:66,582] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities which provide  

[10:1:66,592] water to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.  

[11:0:66,610] The California WaterFix Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,  

[11:1:66,620] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the California WaterFix, project specific environmental  

[11:2:66,630] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and  

[11:3:66,640] federal regulations and permits.  

[12:0:66,658] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE  

[13:0:66,676] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper  

[13:1:66,686] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for the construction. Activities include  

[13:2:66,696] assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use  

[13:3:66,706] of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities,  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:161,32] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in  

[3:1:66,79] cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way  

[3:2:66,89] for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and  

[3:3:66,99] reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities  

[3:4:66,109] associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The  

[3:5:66,120] program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety.  

[3:6:66,137] 3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD  

[4:0:66,155] The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC),  

[4:1:66,165] designated floodways and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by  

[4:2:66,175] issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that  

[4:3:66,186] protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San  

[4:4:66,196] Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large  

[4:5:66,206] joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies that operate  

[4:6:66,216] and maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for  

[4:7:66,226] stakeholders.  

[4:8:66,244] 3255 - SERVICES  

[5:0:66,262] This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning,  

[5:1:66,272] development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory;  

[5:2:66,282] information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies.  

[5:3:66,300] 3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING  

[6:0:66,320] For a limited period of time, this program purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. Beginning  

[6:1:66,331] January 1, 2003, the utility companies resumed responsibility for purchasing power from the spot market. The utilities, however,  

[6:2:66,341] continued to receive power from the Department's long-term energy contracts with energy suppliers, under which the  

[6:3:66,351] Department retains legal and financial responsibility. All energy contracts signed by the Department have now expired or were  

[6:4:66,361] terminated. However, litigation continues against some of the counterparties to these contracts. Additionally, the Department  

[6:5:66,371] retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering $3.213 billion in revenue bonds issued to repay the General Fund  

[6:6:66,382] for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and funding of reserve accounts necessary to maintain an  

[6:7:66,392] investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.

[7:0:66,279] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[8:0:66,297] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control  

[8:1:66,308] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage  

[8:2:66,318] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700  

[8:3:66,328] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated  

[8:4:66,338] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate  

[8:5:66,348] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the  

[8:6:66,359] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank  

[8:7:66,369] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,  

[8:8:66,379] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood  

[8:9:66,389] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[1:0:211,43] 3885   Delta Stewardship Council  

[2:0:66,64] Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is  

[2:1:66,74] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and  

[2:2:66,84] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and  

[2:3:66,95] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted  

[2:4:66,105] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.  

[2:5:66,115] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other  

[2:6:66,125] relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent  

[2:7:66,135] Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to  

[2:8:66,146] inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
