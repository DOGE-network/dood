[25:2:76,604] the continuation of the Bureau’s role to protect students and consumers through the oversight of California’s private  

[25:3:76,615] postsecondary educational institutions. The Budget also includes $1.5 million ongoing Private Postsecondary Education  

[25:4:76,625] Administration Fund to continue operation of the Office of Student Assistance and Relief and the Student Tuition Recovery  

[25:5:76,635] Fund unit, which provide mandatory services to students of private postsecondary institutions.  

[26:0:65,651] • Interstate Distribution of Compounded Medications—The Budget includes $537,000 in 2022-23 and $513,000 in 2023-24 to  

[26:1:76,661] implement Chapter 629, Statutes of 2021 (AB 1533). Of these amounts, $353,000 in 2022-23 and $337,000 in 2023-24, will  

[26:2:76,672] enable the Board of Pharmacy to meet the obligations established in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the  

[26:3:76,682] United States Food and Drug Administration to help address issues related to interstate distribution of large amounts of  

[26:4:76,692] compounded drugs and allow for information sharing across jurisdictions. AB 1533 establishes the necessary reporting  

[26:5:76,702] requirements for compounding pharmacies to implement the MOU.

[11:2:66,460] section 34019.  

[12:0:66,497] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[12:1:65,516] • Cannabis Tax Reform—The Budget includes statutory changes to reform cannabis taxes, provide relief to equity cannabis  

[12:2:76,526] retailers, and authorize high-road cannabis employers and cannabis equity operators to claim tax credits. These policy  

[12:3:76,536] changes simplify the tax structure and remove administrative burdens and costs, which reduces barriers to entry into the  

[12:4:76,547] legal, regulated cannabis market. Major changes include the following: 1) effective July 1, 2022, eliminate the cultivation tax  

[12:5:76,557] on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market; 2) effective January 1, 2023, shift the point of collection and  

[12:6:76,567] remittance for excise tax from distribution to retail, maintaining a 15-percent excise tax rate through 2024-25; and 3) until  

[12:7:76,577] December 31, 2025, allow equity cannabis retailers who have received an equity fee waiver from the Department of  

[12:8:76,587] Cannabis Control to retain 20 percent of the excise tax they collect, as a reimbursement for all costs associated with the  

[12:9:76,598] collection of the cannabis excise tax; among other changes.  

[13:0:65,614] • Cannabis Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant Program—The Budget includes $20.5 million one-time General Fund to  

[13:1:76,624] establish a grant program that will provide funding to cities and counties that do not currently have a local cannabis retailer  

[13:2:76,634] licensing program. This program is intended to aid localities with the development and implementation of local retail licensing  

[13:3:76,644] programs and to support consumers in gaining access to regulated and tested products through an expansion of California’s  

[13:4:76,655] legal marketplace.  

[14:0:65,671] • Cannabis Control Fund—The Budget includes $13.6 million one-time Cannabis Control Fund in 2022-23 for the Department  

[14:1:76,681] to: 1)   begin activities for developing a single licensing system; 2) implement a consumer awareness campaign; and 3)  

[14:2:76,691] establish a data warehouse to store and query Department data, appropriate processes and procedures to maintain data  

[14:3:76,701] integrity, and data displays and visualizations for the Department's website. These efforts will enable the Department to  

[14:4:76,712] analyze and better share licensing and compliance data with state partners and public stakeholders, help inform the

[10:1:66,446] vibrant communities throughout California by (1) administering housing finance, economic development, and community  

[10:2:66,456] development programs, (2) developing housing policy and advocating for an adequate housing supply, and (3) developing
