[7:3:66,354] surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers,  

[7:4:66,364] health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this  

[7:5:66,374] mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and  

[7:6:66,384] analyze prescription drug cost data and health care payment data to improve transparency, inform policy decisions, reduce  

[7:7:66,394] disparities, and reduce health care costs. 

[7:8:66,412] 3860 - ADMINISTRATION

[1:0:228,43] 4170   Department of Aging  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, and  

[2:1:66,74] families through:  

[3:0:65,92] • Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives,  

[3:1:65,108] • Opportunities for community involvement,  

[3:2:65,124] • Support to family members providing care, and  

[3:3:65,141] • Collaboration with other state and local agencies.  

[4:0:66,158] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that  

[4:1:66,168] provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and  

[4:2:66,179] Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate  

[4:3:66,189] the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-

[4:4:66,199] Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid.  

[5:0:66,219] The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the  

[5:1:66,230] local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults  

[5:2:66,240] with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

[7:3:76,315] suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget  

[7:4:76,325] Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal  

[7:5:76,336] years.

[5:0:66,218] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,236] 3890 - NUTRITION  

[6:0:66,256] The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60  

[6:1:66,266] years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the  

[6:2:66,277] isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and  

[6:3:66,287] assistance, employment, and education.  

[6:4:66,304] 3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE  

[7:0:66,325] The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized  

[7:1:66,335] training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also  

[7:2:66,345] promotes transition to unsubsidized employment.  

[7:3:66,363] 3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES  

[8:0:66,381] This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers,  

[8:1:66,391] grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance,  

[8:2:66,401] legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term  

[8:3:66,411] Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support  

[8:4:66,421] necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care  

[8:5:66,432] services appropriate to their needs.  

[8:6:66,449] 3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS  

[9:0:66,467] This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides  

[9:1:66,477] personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local  

[9:2:66,487] source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans.  

[9:3:66,505] 3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS  

[10:0:66,523] This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services  

[10:1:66,533] (CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age or over who  

[10:2:66,543] are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or disabilities. The  

[10:3:66,553] Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-

[10:4:66,564] based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term  

[10:5:66,574] care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all  

[2:1:66,74] Californians through the following core activities:  

[3:0:65,92] • Protecting the public from communicable diseases.  

[4:0:65,108] • Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments.  

[5:0:65,124] • Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities.  

[5:1:65,141] • Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.  

[6:0:65,157] • Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to  

[6:1:76,167] guide public health strategies, programs, and actions.  

[7:0:65,183] • Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces.  

[7:1:65,199] • Providing access to quality, population-based health services.  

[8:0:66,217] Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to

[1:0:176,43] 4300   Department of Developmental Services  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for  

[2:1:66,74] providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and  

[2:2:66,84] productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides  

[2:3:66,95] leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the  

[2:4:66,105] developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems  

[2:5:66,115] that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies  

[2:6:66,125] known as regional centers as well as through developmental centers and a state-operated community facility. The Department,  

[2:7:66,135] through the 21 regional centers, oversees coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities; provides that  

[2:8:66,146] such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to  

[2:9:66,156] the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community.  

[3:0:66,174] The Department has a capital outlay program to support its state operated facilities and the infrastructure investment. For the  

[3:1:66,184] specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:201,43] 4440   Department of State Hospitals  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is  

[2:1:66,74] to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital  

[2:2:66,84] operations, across a continuum of care. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health  

[2:3:66,95] treatment for its patients in five state hospitals located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and  

[3:0:66,105] Patton,   and employs over 11,000 staff. Additionally, the Department provides services in jail-based competency treatment  

[3:1:66,115] programs and conditional release programs throughout the 58 counties. In 2017-18, the Department served approximately  

[3:2:66,125] 12,000 patients within state hospitals and jail-based facilities, with average daily censuses of 5,897 and 227 respectively. The  

[3:3:66,135] conditional release program (CONREP) reflected an average daily census of approximately 654.  

[4:0:66,153] Because the Department of State Hospitals' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[4:1:66,163] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[4:2:66,174] Overview."

[5:2:76,144] five state hospitals. This will increase the number of direct-care nursing staffing in an effort   to reduce patient violence, staff  

[5:3:76,154] injuries, and staff turnover and absenteeism. In addition, the Budget includes 304 positions to better reflect the State  

[5:4:76,164] Hospital's usage of temporary help staff.

[8:3:76,284] evaluations and reports statewide, and reduce the amount of time treating clinicians spend in court, enabling them to focus  

[8:4:76,295] on patient treatment.  

[9:0:65,311] • Mission-Based Review: Workforce Development—The Budget includes $1.8 million total fund and 8 positions to: (1) expand

[7:0:66,318] 4440 - EVALUATION AND FORENSIC SERVICES  

[8:0:66,335] Evaluation and Forensic Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender and the Sex Offender Commitment  

[8:1:66,346] Programs. Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of  

[8:2:66,356] Parole Hearings to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs  

[8:3:66,366] evaluations to determine if individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the Mentally Disordered Offender program. These  

[8:4:66,376] evaluations are used by the Board of Parole Hearings in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of  

[8:5:66,386] State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995)  

[8:6:66,397] was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to  

[8:7:66,407] be sexually violent predators. The Sex Offender Commitment Program administers clinical screenings and performs  

[8:8:66,417] evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for a sexually violent predator commitment to the  

[8:9:66,427] Department of State Hospitals upon completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the ultimate determination whether  

[8:10:66,437] an individual is likely to be a sexually violent predator and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department of  

[8:11:66,448] State Hospitals.

[5:1:66,185] 4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS  

[6:0:66,206] The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through  

[6:1:66,216] financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services.  

[7:0:66,236] The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households  

[7:1:66,247] to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related  

[7:2:66,257] emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard  

[7:3:66,267] the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which  

[7:4:66,277] supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used  

[7:5:66,287] along with LIHEAP weatherization related services.  

[8:0:66,308] The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-

[8:1:66,318] income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants.  

[8:2:66,336] The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides weatherization and renewable energy services in low-income  

[8:3:66,346] single-family and multi-family dwellings within disadvantaged communities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LIWP  

[8:4:66,356] includes projects such as weatherization and solar water heater and solar photovoltaic systems installations.  

[8:5:66,374] 4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES  

[9:0:66,394] The Community Services Block Grant is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community organizations to  

[9:1:66,404] help low-income families achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through a broad range of activities. These activities include  

[9:2:66,415] education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional  

[9:3:66,425] services. Additionally, Community Services Block Grant funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-

[9:4:66,435] income communities.  

[10:0:66,453] The California Earned Income Tax Credit (Cal EITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax  

[10:1:66,463] credits to boost the income of eligible families. In 2017-18 and 2018-19, CSD has worked with the Franchise Tax Board and  

[10:2:66,473] non-profit and community-based organizations to increase awareness of the Cal EITC and provide free tax preparation  

[10:3:66,483] assistance to Californians.

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,94] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES  

[5:0:66,115] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities through  

[5:1:66,125] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state. In addition, the Department  

[5:2:66,135] has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (education, mental health, and welfare) to provide services to  

[5:3:66,145] consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, which gives priority to persons with the most  

[5:4:66,156] significant disabilities.  

[6:0:66,176] Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of  

[6:1:66,186] services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, and  

[6:2:66,196] independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities.  

[7:0:66,217] The Department provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to enable persons who are blind or visually  

[7:1:66,227] impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational services are  

[7:2:66,237] provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to newly blind adults to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation services and  

[7:3:66,247] independent living.  

[8:0:66,268] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation  

[8:1:66,278] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and  

[8:2:66,288] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.  

[9:0:66,309] The Department works with the federal government to administer two grant programs. The Promoting the Readiness of Minors  

[9:1:66,319] in Supplemental Security Income grant develops projects to promote positive outcomes for children who receive Supplemental  

[9:2:66,329] Security Income and their families. The CA Innovations Program seeks to increase the self-sufficiency of students with  

[9:3:66,339] disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and planned education to prepare them for workplace success.  

[10:0:66,357] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES  

[11:0:66,377] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout  

[11:1:66,388] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently   with full  

[11:2:66,398] inclusion   in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems  

[11:3:66,408] change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion  

[11:4:66,418] services to community based living, and   transition services to postsecondary life for youth.  

[12:0:66,439] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their  

[12:1:66,449] families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with  

[12:2:66,459] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for  

[12:3:66,469] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community.  

[13:0:66,490] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 19 non-profit community-based  

[13:1:66,500] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually  

[13:2:66,510] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low  

[13:3:66,520] vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, independent living  

[13:4:66,530] skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.  

[14:0:66,548] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[15:0:66,566] The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,94] 4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,112] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing  

[4:1:66,122] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and  

[4:2:66,133] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-

[4:3:66,143] D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary  

[4:4:66,153] Assistance for Needy Families block grant.  

[4:5:66,171] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION:  

[5:0:66,188] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating  

[5:1:66,199] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The  

[5:2:66,209] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.  

[5:3:66,226] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:  

[6:0:66,244] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal  

[6:1:66,254] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State  

[6:2:66,265] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts  

[6:3:66,275] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support  

[6:4:66,285] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments  

[6:5:66,295] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program  

[6:6:66,305] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[3:2:76,89] thereafter, the State will fund emergency assistance payments for up to three months, as local child welfare agencies and  

[3:3:76,99] probation departments are anticipated to complete the resource family approval process on a timelier basis.  

[4:0:65,115] • Resource Family Approval Administration and Application Backlog—The Budget includes $14.4 million one-time General  

[4:1:76,126] Fund in 2019-20 to support county efforts in eliminating the backlog of foster care resource family applications that are

[5:3:76,183] for foster youth, and reduce law enforcement calls and needless criminalization of youth. The increased funding for Family  

[5:4:76,193] Urgent Response will be suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines  

[5:5:76,203] through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the  

[5:6:76,213] subsequent two fiscal years.

[9:3:76,349] provision of legal services to unaccompanied undocumented minors and Temporary Protected Status beneficiaries, and $7  

[9:4:76,360] million ongoing General Fund will be used to support persons on California State University campuses. Additionally, the  

[9:5:76,370] Budget includes $25 million one-time General Fund for the Rapid Response Program to support entities that provide critical  

[9:6:76,380] assistance/services to immigrants during emergent situations when federal funding is not available.

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,94] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS  

[5:0:66,115] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support  

[5:1:66,125] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components:  

[6:0:65,143] • California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)  

[7:0:65,159] • Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food  

[7:1:76,169] Assistance Programs  

[8:0:65,185] • Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program  

[9:0:65,202] • County Administration and Automation Projects  

[10:0:65,218] • Disaster Relief  

[11:0:66,246] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to  

[11:1:66,256] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,  

[11:2:66,266] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.  

[12:0:66,284] 4270010 - CalWORKs:  

[13:0:66,301] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is  

[13:1:66,312] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic  

[13:2:66,322] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes  

[13:3:66,332] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet  

[13:4:66,342] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs  

[13:5:66,352] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the  

[13:6:66,363] Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by the California Department of Education. Parents  

[13:7:66,373] have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs  

[13:8:66,383] families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and  

[13:9:66,393] development services.  

[14:0:66,411] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:  

[15:0:66,429] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term  

[15:1:66,439] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as  

[15:2:66,449] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is  

[15:3:66,459] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social  

[15:4:66,469] Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to  

[15:5:66,480] relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system.  

[16:0:66,497] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate  

[16:1:66,508] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in  

[16:2:66,518] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and  

[16:3:66,528] state law.  

[17:0:66,546] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:  

[18:0:65,563] • The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States  

[18:1:76,574] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.  

[19:0:65,591] • The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and  

[19:1:76,601] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States  

[19:2:76,612] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the  

[19:3:76,622] minor.  

[20:0:65,640] • The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human  

[20:1:76,650] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are  

[20:2:76,660] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under  

[20:3:76,670] CalWORKs).  

[21:0:66,688] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of  

[21:1:66,698] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of  

[21:2:66,708] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:1:66,79] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.  

[3:2:66,89] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in  

[3:3:66,99] employment and training activities.  

[4:0:66,117] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution  

[4:1:66,127] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for  

[4:2:66,137] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with  

[4:3:66,148] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a  

[4:4:66,158] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.  

[5:0:66,175] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious  

[5:1:66,186] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity  

[5:2:66,196] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services  

[5:3:66,206] on October 1, 2016.  

[6:0:66,224] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:  

[7:0:66,241] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled  

[7:1:66,252] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a  

[7:2:66,262] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who  

[7:3:66,272] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.  

[8:0:66,290] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:  

[9:0:66,307] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who  

[9:1:66,318] administer public assistance programs.  

[10:0:66,335] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.  

[11:0:66,353] 4270046 - Disaster Relief:  

[12:0:66,371] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have  

[12:1:66,381] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance  

[12:2:66,391] programs.  

[13:0:66,409] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING  

[14:0:66,427] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child  

[14:1:66,437] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and  

[14:2:66,447] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of  

[14:3:66,457] the service delivery system.  

[15:0:66,475] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:  

[16:0:66,493] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in  

[16:1:66,503] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who  

[16:2:66,513] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs  

[16:3:66,523] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,  

[16:4:66,533] and IHSS-Residual Program.  

[17:0:66,551] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:  

[18:0:66,569] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse  

[18:1:66,579] Prevention.  

[19:0:66,597] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and  

[19:1:66,607] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated  

[19:2:66,617] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with  

[19:3:66,627] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and  

[19:4:66,637] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from  

[19:5:66,648] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.  

[20:0:66,665] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter  

[20:1:66,676] 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to change  

[20:2:66,686] out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment and case  

[20:3:66,696] planning.

[3:0:66,69] The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and  

[3:1:66,79] private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for  

[3:2:66,89] children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services  

[3:3:66,99] include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents;  

[3:4:66,109] training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For  

[3:5:66,120] independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the  

[3:6:66,130] biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.  

[3:7:66,148] The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and

[3:9:66,168] services for at risk families and their children.  

[4:0:66,186] The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of physical and financial abuse and  

[4:1:66,196] neglect or exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary.  

[4:2:66,214] The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health  

[4:3:66,224] and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes  

[4:4:66,234] facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components.

[5:3:66,307] 4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER  

[6:0:66,325] The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project provides  

[6:1:66,335] participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state foster care  

[6:2:66,346] maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable.  

[6:3:66,363] 4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES  

[7:0:66,381] The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and  

[7:1:66,391] provide administrative services to other agencies.  

[7:2:66,409] 4285010 - Disability Evaluation:  

[8:0:66,427] The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents  

[8:1:66,437] applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of  

[8:2:66,447] the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and  

[8:3:66,457] overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.  

[8:4:66,475] 4285019 - Services to Other Agencies:  

[9:0:66,493] In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative  

[9:1:66,503] services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human  

[9:2:66,513] Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public  

[9:3:66,523] information services.  

[9:4:66,541] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,94] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT  

[5:0:66,115] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve  

[5:1:66,125] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability  

[5:2:66,135] for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage  

[5:3:66,145] cost-effective approaches to providing services.  

[6:0:66,166] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[6:1:66,176] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts  

[6:2:66,186] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified  

[6:3:66,196] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to  

[6:4:66,207] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision  

[6:5:66,217] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for  

[6:6:66,227] county health and social services programs.

[1:0:202,43] 5196   2011 State-Local Realignment  

[1:1:66,64] Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a  

[1:2:66,74] dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility.  

[1:3:66,95] Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services,  

[1:4:66,105] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is  

[1:5:66,115] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and  

[1:6:66,125] technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at  

[1:7:66,135] less cost.  

[1:8:66,156] The funding sources for realignment are:  

[1:9:65,174] • The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.  

[1:10:65,190] • The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[2:0:66,218] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:  

[2:1:65,235] • Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services)  

[2:2:65,252] • Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care;  

[2:3:76,262] Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment)  

[2:4:65,278] • Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs)  

[2:5:65,294] • Trial Court Security Subaccount  

[3:0:65,310] • Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and  

[3:1:76,321] Adult Parole)  

[3:2:65,337] • Community Corrections Subaccount  

[3:3:65,353] • District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount  

[4:0:65,369] • Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant  

[4:1:76,379] Special Account)  

[5:0:66,407] The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on  

[5:1:66,417] statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures.  

[6:0:66,438] Note the $5 billion in   2018-19 and $5.2 billion in 2019-20 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety  

[6:1:66,448] programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full
