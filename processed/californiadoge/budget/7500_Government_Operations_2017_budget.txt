[1:0:209,44] 7502 Department of Technology 

[1:1:58,64] The Department of Technology is the central information technology (IT) organization for the State of California. The 

[1:2:58,73] Department is responsible for the approval and oversight of statewide IT projects, statewide IT professional development, 

[1:3:58,82] and provides centralized IT services to state and local governments as well as non-governmental entities. The Department 

[1:4:58,91] promulgates statewide IT security policies and procedures, and has responsibility over telecommunication and IT 

[1:5:58,100] procurements. 

[2:0:58,118] Because the Department of Technology's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital 

[2:1:58,127] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[1:0:194,44] 7760 Department of General Services 

[1:1:58,64] Effective July 1, 2013, the Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 2012 created the Government Operations Agency and, 

[1:2:58,73] as part of the plan, moved the Department of General Services (DGS) (previously budgeted within State and Consumer 

[1:3:58,82] Services Agency under Organization Code 1760) to this new Agency (Government Operations). 

[2:0:58,100] As an enterprise organization, DGS provides centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-

[2:1:58,109] owned and leased real estate, including design and construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural 

[2:2:58,118] designs for local schools and other state-owned building; printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and 

[2:3:58,127] equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's vehicle fleet. Furthermore, the Department of General 

[3:0:58,136] Services employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve California resources. 

[3:1:58,145] The Director of General Services serves on several state boards and commissions. 

[4:0:58,163] Since department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay 

[4:1:58,172] program to support this need. For the specifics on the DGS' Capital Outlay Program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[17:0:58,636] 6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES 

[18:0:58,654] With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for 

[18:1:58,663] inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in 

[18:2:58,672] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state 

[18:3:58,681] funds are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and 

[18:4:58,690] public building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to 

[18:5:58,699] school districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; 

[18:6:58,708] and (e) Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.

[1:0:159,44] 7760 Department of General Services - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, 

[2:1:58,91] and equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 

[2:2:58,109] 6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 

[3:0:58,127] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid 

[3:1:58,136] redundancy, and deliver property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate 

[3:2:58,145] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Assuring protection of lives 

[3:3:58,154] and property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most 

[3:4:58,163] qualified parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to 

[3:5:58,172] deliver their programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for 

[3:6:58,181] state agencies, and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the 

[3:7:58,190] public's interests and ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 

[3:8:58,208] 6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 

[4:0:58,226] To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which 

[4:1:58,235] are basic to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include procurement of green and sustainable 

[4:2:58,244] materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency 

[4:3:58,253] support requirements include travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-

[4:4:58,262] wide sustainability, energy efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and 

[4:5:58,271] human resources services. Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative judges to 

[4:6:58,280] conduct quasi-judicial hearings and mediations authorized by law. 

[4:7:58,298] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION 

[5:0:58,316] The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This 

[5:1:58,325] program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services, 

[5:2:58,334] auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative 

[5:3:58,343] services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, labor relations, information technology, 

[5:4:58,352] health and safety, procurement, and contracting.

[9:3:58,397] consistent imposition and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of 

[9:4:58,406] Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.

[7:0:58,402] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[8:0:58,418] • 

[9:0:68,421] The Budget includes an increase to the state's pension contribution due to the CalPERS Board's action in 2016 to lower 

[9:1:68,430] the assumed rate of return for the system. The assumption change increased the system's liabilities, resulting in an 

[9:2:68,439] increase to the state's funding obligation. 

[10:0:58,454] • 

[11:0:68,457] The Budget includes a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension payment to CalPERS to mitigate the increase in state 

[11:1:68,466] contributions, as described above. The additional payment will be funded through a loan from the Surplus Money 

[11:2:68,475] Investment Fund. The $6 billion payment will be apportioned accordingly to the five state retirement plans based on the 

[11:3:68,484] unfunded liability of each plan.

[1:0:142,44] 7900 Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 6410 - RETIREMENT 

[4:0:58,127] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits 

[4:1:58,136] for employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the 

[4:2:58,145] line of duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2016, there were about 1,211,000 active and inactive 

[4:3:58,154] members, and about 649,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 

[4:4:58,172] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final 

[4:5:58,181] compensation. There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace 

[4:6:58,190] Officer/Firefighter, California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and 

[4:7:58,199] districts that contract with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be 

[4:8:58,208] limited to one of five benefit formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract 

[4:9:58,217] provisions. 

[5:0:58,235] As of June 30, 2016, there were 3,021 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, 

[5:1:58,244] and survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 

[5:2:58,253] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 

[5:3:58,262] retirement systems. 

[6:0:58,280] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 

[6:1:58,298] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 

[7:0:58,316] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 

[7:1:58,325] associations, and others to provide health and long-term care insurance for state, California State University, and local 

[7:2:58,334] public agency employees, retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, 

[7:3:58,343] develops cost-effective programs, provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with 

[7:4:58,352] employee organizations and employer representatives. 

[8:0:58,370] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 

[8:1:58,379] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 

[8:2:58,388] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an 

[8:3:58,397] impartial intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 

[8:4:58,415] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 

[9:0:58,433] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 

[9:1:58,442] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 

[9:2:58,451] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, assets have grown from $800,000 to a total of 

[9:3:58,460] $302 billion, as of June 30, 2016. 

[9:4:58,478] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION 

[10:0:58,496] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 

[10:1:58,505] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Strategy Performance, 

[10:2:58,514] Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Operational Support, and 

[10:3:58,523] Public Affairs.

[8:2:58,410] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting 

[8:3:58,419] these regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is 

[8:4:58,428] also responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that 

[8:5:58,437] have been recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory 

[8:6:58,446] agencies through a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with 

[8:7:58,455] the Administrative Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state 

[8:8:58,464] agencies and members of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 

[9:0:58,482] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 

[9:1:58,491] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 

[9:2:58,500] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 

[10:0:58,518] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and 

[10:1:58,527] the California Regulatory Notice Register.

[4:0:58,127] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for 

[4:1:58,136] the distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, 

[4:2:58,145] the largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic 

[4:3:58,154] retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The 

[4:4:58,163] member may modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their 

[4:5:58,172] beneficiary after the member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date 

[4:6:58,181] of the member's retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by 

[4:7:58,190] statute and/or contract provisions. 

[5:0:58,208] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 

[5:1:58,217] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The 

[5:2:58,226] cost of administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
