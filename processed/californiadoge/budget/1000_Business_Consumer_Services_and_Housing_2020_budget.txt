[2:0:124,29] 1690   Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission was established in 1975 to provide a coordinated framework for establishing  

[3:1:66,93] consistent earthquake policies, advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public, and tracking the  

[3:2:66,103] state’s progress toward higher levels of seismic safety. To support this broad mission, the Commission uses the expertise of its  

[3:3:66,113] commissioners to review, evaluate, and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence  

[3:4:66,124] earthquake safety policies.  

[4:0:66,141] The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that  

[4:1:66,152] support the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. These activities include: (1) developing and  

[4:2:66,162] reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing a consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related  

[4:3:66,172] legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies,  

[4:4:66,182] where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and  

[4:5:66,192] supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery.  

[4:6:66,210] The Budget reflects the transfer of the Commission to the Office of Emergency Services beginning in 2020-21.

[18:0:66,518] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[18:1:65,538] • California Consumer Financial Protection – The Budget includes $10.2 million growing to $19.3 million in 2022-23, in a set-

[18:2:76,548] aside item to provide consumers—especially financially vulnerable populations—with more protection against unfair,  

[18:3:76,558] deceptive, and abusive practices when accessing financial services and products.   The expenditure of these funds is  

[18:4:76,568] contingent upon enactment of statutory changes that authorize the California Consumer Financial Protection Law program.  

[18:5:76,578] The Administration and Legislature will work together over the summer   to finalize the statutory framework needed to  

[18:6:76,589] implement the program and other changes that aim to improve consumer protection for all Californians. This proposal  

[18:7:76,599] includes: 1) creating a new Division of Consumer Financial Protection, and a related California Consumer Financial  

[18:8:76,609] Protection Law, to expand oversight over current and emerging abusive acts and practices that cause consumers financial  

[18:9:76,619] harm, and promote consumer-focused research and outreach; and 2) establishes an Office of Financial Technology  

[18:10:76,629] Innovation to study emerging technologies in financial services, including virtual currencies, and to engage with California  

[18:11:76,640] companies developing new financial products and services.

[1:0:411,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — BCH   97 

[2:0:99,29] 2240   Department of Housing and Community Development - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] †   Fiscal year 2018-19 budget information reflects the latest available estimates for this department and/or fund(s). Changes  

[3:1:66,97] resulting from the final reconciliation of the 2018-19 ending fund balance will be reflected as a prior year adjustment in the  

[3:2:66,107] 2021-22 Governor’s Budget publication.  

[4:0:66,134] LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY  

[5:0:66,153] DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY  

[6:0:66,174] Government Code section 65580 et seq.; Health and Safety Code sections 18000 et seq. and 50000 et seq.  

[7:0:66,211] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:0:65,230] • Federal Community Development Block Grant Program—The Budget includes $1.1 billion in federal disaster assistance  

[8:1:76,240] funds to assist the state in its mitigation and disaster preparedness efforts in light of housing instability of victims of recent  

[8:2:76,251] natural disasters.  

[8:3:65,267] • Strategic Investments and   Maximizing Federal Funds—Due to the   fiscal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Budget  

[8:4:76,277] makes strategic reductions designed to have minimal impact on state   housing production efforts   while maximizing the use of  

[8:5:76,287] potential federal funds if they become available. The Budget reverts $203 million for HCD's Infill Infrastructure Grant  

[8:6:76,297] Program of 2019   and $45 million for CalHFA's Mixed Income Program in 2020-21   that was appropriated in the 2019 Budget  

[8:7:76,308] Act. While federal funds may restore these reductions, these programs will have other sources of funding to continue  

[8:8:76,318] operations.  

[9:0:65,334] • Transit-Oriented Development Program Alignment—The Budget aligns the schedule for   the Transit-Oriented Development  

[9:1:76,344] Program to issue more awards for housing   production near major transit areas. HCD can award up to   $141 million in  

[9:2:76,354] available   Proposition 1 funds   in 2020-21. Additionally, HCD can award $19.9 million in available Proposition 1c funds for the  

[9:3:76,365] Transit-Oriented Development Program.  

[9:4:65,381] • Homekey—The Budget includes $600 million ($50 million General Fund and $550 million   to be transferred from the  

[9:5:76,391] Coronavirus Relief Fund)   to support the acquisition, conversion, and rehabilitation of hotels, motels, and other properties to  

[9:6:76,401] provide housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness due to the COVID-19  

[9:7:76,411] pandemic.
