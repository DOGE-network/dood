[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2020-21 STATE BUDGET — EDU   1 

[1:0:216,53] 6100   Department of Education  

[2:0:66,75] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of  

[2:1:66,85] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million  

[2:2:66,95] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Equity and Access Branch; the  

[3:0:66,105] Operations and Administration Branch; the Opportunities for All Branch; the Instruction and Measurement Branch; and the  

[3:1:66,116] Legal and Audits Branch.  

[4:0:66,136] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to  

[4:1:66,146] work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding  

[5:0:66,156] local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to  

[5:1:66,167] enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and  

[6:0:66,177] supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that  

[6:1:66,187] promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the  

[7:0:66,197] administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing  

[8:0:66,207] broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering  

[8:1:66,218] systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help  

[8:2:66,228] students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that  

[9:0:66,238] promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the  

[9:1:66,248] effectiveness and efficiency of the Department.  

[10:0:66,269] Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[10:1:66,279] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[10:2:66,289] Overview."

[9:0:112,445] 6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System  

[10:0:66,467] The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS).  

[11:0:66,484] The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members'  

[11:1:66,495] creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an  

[11:2:66,505] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on  

[11:3:66,515] July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three  

[11:4:66,525] years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase  

[11:5:66,535] the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.  

[12:0:66,553] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in  

[12:1:66,563] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing  

[12:2:66,574] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection  

[12:3:66,584] payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to  

[12:4:66,594] set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to  

[12:5:66,604] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an  

[12:6:66,614] amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding  

[12:7:66,625] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15  

[12:8:66,635] of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’  

[12:9:66,645] Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)  

[12:10:66,655] increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[8:0:66,343] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:1:65,362] • The Budget includes $3.4 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The Budget also   suspends the authority  

[8:2:76,372] of the Teachers’ Retirement Board to increase the state’s contribution in fiscal year 2020-21 pursuant to Education Code  

[8:3:76,382] section 22955.1. Program 5350 includes $169 million, which is the value of the increase in state contribution in fiscal year  

[8:4:76,392] 2020-21 had the Teachers Retirement Board had the authority to increase the state rate.   The related savings, as a result of  

[8:5:76,403] the rate suspension, is accounted for separately and not included in this display.   The Budget instead provides CalSTRS a  

[8:6:76,413] $297 million supplemental pension payment using Proposition 2 debt repayment funding, as displayed in Program 9990 and  

[8:7:76,423] as described below.  

[9:0:65,439] • In addition to the state’s statutorily-required annual contribution, the Budget includes a   $297 million supplemental pension  

[9:1:76,449] payment   to CalSTRS in   2020-21. Education Code section 22955.2 authorizes   the state to make supplemental pension  

[9:2:76,460] payments   to CalSTRS towards the state's share of the unfunded liability for the   Defined Benefit Program. Approximately  

[9:3:76,470] $2.9 billion is scheduled to be paid   over fiscal years 2019-20 through 2023-24 using available Proposition 2 debt payment  

[9:4:76,480] funding.

[7:0:202,286] 6350   School Facilities Aid Program  

[8:0:66,308] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities  

[8:1:66,318] such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.   This program is administered by the State Allocation  

[8:2:66,328] Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 

[9:0:66,348] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility  

[9:1:66,359] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in  

[9:2:66,369] statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.   These funds primarily  

[9:3:66,379] support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through  

[9:4:66,389] the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding  

[9:5:66,399] relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7)  

[9:6:66,410] seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general  

[9:7:66,420] obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3  

[9:8:66,430] billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical  

[9:9:66,440] education projects. 

[10:0:66,458] The 2018 Budget Act provided one-time General Fund to support the Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program to help  

[10:1:66,468] school districts address the facility costs associated with providing full-day kindergarten programs.   The Full-Day Kindergarten  

[10:2:66,478] Facilities Grant Program is also administered by the State Allocation Board.

[5:0:66,257] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,276] 5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS  

[7:0:66,297] This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure  

[7:1:66,307] a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students.  

[8:0:66,327] The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 281,000 applications annually for  

[8:1:66,338] credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the  

[8:2:66,348] primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential  

[8:3:66,358] personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued.  

[9:0:66,378] The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas,  

[9:1:66,389] aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including  

[9:2:66,399] the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and  

[9:3:66,409] development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the  

[9:4:66,419] Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to  

[9:5:66,429] monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of  

[9:6:66,440] program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program  

[9:7:66,450] approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated  

[9:8:66,460] assignments in collaboration with county offices of education.  

[10:0:66,480] The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal  

[10:1:66,491] advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of  

[10:2:66,501] Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and  

[10:3:66,511] applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct  

[10:4:66,521] disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions.  

[11:0:66,539] 5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES  

[12:0:66,559] This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline  

[12:1:66,569] cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process.  

[13:0:66,587] 5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT  

[14:0:66,605] The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher  

[14:1:66,615] preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface.  

[15:0:66,633] 5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS  

[16:0:66,653] This program supports development and implementation of   Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation  

[16:1:66,663] programs that lead to a teaching or administative services credential.   In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are  

[16:2:66,674] prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be  

[16:3:66,684] included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment.

[6:0:221,269] 6440   University of California  

[7:0:66,290] The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic  

[7:1:66,300] programs through the doctoral degree level; research; education for professional careers; and public service.  

[8:0:66,318] UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 1879 as  

[8:1:66,328] a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the following 26  

[8:2:66,338] members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms,  

[8:3:66,349] and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents.  

[9:0:66,366] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. In  

[9:1:66,377] addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment primarily  

[9:2:66,387] responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law.  

[10:0:66,404] There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa  

[10:1:66,415] Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.  

[10:2:66,425] The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and  

[10:3:66,435] administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States  

[10:4:66,445] Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories.  

[10:5:66,463] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource  

[10:6:66,473] allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated  

[10:7:66,483] authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

[5:0:66,401] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[6:0:66,420] UC's General Fund resources reflect a   decrease of a $258.7 million,   which is the result of   augmentations totaling $212.9 million  

[6:1:66,430] and   reductions totaling $471.6 million.  

[7:0:65,448] • Ongoing General Fund Augmentations—An ongoing   increase of $212.3 million General Fund includes:  

[7:1:74,466] ◦ $169.2 million for a base adjustment to mitigate the impact of contingent General Fund reductions.  

[7:2:74,482] ◦ $25 million for UC Riverside School of Medicine operational costs.  

[7:3:74,498] ◦ $15 million for the UC Merced-UCSF Fresno Partnership for a Branch Medical School Campus.  

[7:4:74,514] ◦ $3.7 million   ($3.1 million of which is ongoing)   to offset declining Proposition 56 revenue supporting a statewide grant  

[7:5:85,524] program to increase the number of available graduate medical residency slots.  

[7:6:74,541] ◦ $345,000 for a baseline immigrant legal services adjustment.  

[8:0:65,564] • Contingent   General Fund Reductions—Absent additional federal funds pursuant to Control Section 8.28, a decrease of  

[8:1:76,574] $471.6 million   reflecting:  

[8:2:74,592] ◦ $428.4 million for UC operational costs.  

[9:0:74,608] ◦ $43.2 million for UC Office of the President, UC PATH, and the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,72] 5530 - This program provides support for Hastings.   Expenditures are for the following purposes:  

[4:0:66,93] INSTRUCTION  

[5:0:66,113] Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal  

[5:1:66,123] profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services.  

[6:0:66,144] The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal  

[6:1:66,154] profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students  

[6:2:66,164] with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism  

[6:3:66,174] for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in  

[6:4:66,185] overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice.  

[7:0:66,205] ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY  

[8:0:66,225] The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference  

[8:1:66,236] and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom  

[8:2:66,246] presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law  

[8:3:66,256] library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys.

[10:1:66,307] Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program.   These offices provide  

[10:2:66,317] students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist  

[10:3:66,327] students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment  

[10:4:66,338] opportunities.   These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support  

[10:5:66,348] Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other  

[10:6:66,358] services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students).  

[11:0:66,378] INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT  

[12:0:66,399] Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety,  

[12:1:66,409] community relations, and administrative services.  

[13:0:66,429] OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT  

[14:0:66,450] Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and  

[14:1:66,460] administration of maintenance and renovation activities   for the college's plant.

[1:0:498,13] EDUCATION 

[2:0:177,29] 6610   California State University - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses.   All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate  

[3:1:66,93] instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal arts   education programs.   For undergraduate programs, each  

[3:2:66,103] campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student.   In addition to master's-

[3:3:66,113] level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and  

[3:4:66,124] audiology.   The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions.  

[3:5:66,141] The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16  

[3:6:66,152] members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student  

[3:7:66,162] representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year  

[3:8:66,172] term by the CSU Alumni Council.   The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents.   The Trustees, the  

[3:9:66,182] Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy.   The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty  

[3:10:66,192] representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor.  

[3:11:66,210] The CSU’s goals include to:  

[4:0:65,228] • Advance and extend knowledge, learning, and culture, especially throughout California.  

[5:0:65,244] • Prepare significant numbers of educated, responsible people to contribute to California’s schools, economy, culture, and  

[5:1:76,254] future.  

[6:0:65,270] • Offer undergraduate and graduate instruction leading to bachelor’s and higher degrees in the liberal arts and sciences,  

[6:1:76,281] applied fields, and the professions, including the doctoral degree when authorized.  

[6:2:65,297] • Prepare students for international, multi-cultural society.  

[6:3:65,313] • Provide public services that enrich the university and its communities.

[21:0:66,669] AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES  

[22:0:66,687] An auxiliary enterprise exists to furnish goods or services to students, faculty, or staff, other institutional departments, or  

[22:1:66,697] incidentally to the general public, and charges a fee directly related to the cost of the goods or services.   The distinguishing  

[22:2:66,707] characteristic of an auxiliary enterprise is that it is managed as an essentially self-supporting activity.   Examples are residence

[12:0:66,649] This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their  

[12:1:66,659] dependents.  

[13:0:66,679] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health  

[13:1:66,689] plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed.  

[14:0:66,710] The 2019-20 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:1:66,93] hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest  

[3:2:66,103] health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also  

[3:3:66,113] contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents.  

[4:0:66,134] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[4:1:66,144] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2019 monthly contribution  

[4:2:66,154] maximums are $734 for a single enrollee, $1,398 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,788 for an enrollee and two or  

[4:3:66,164] more dependents. The 2020 monthly contribution maximums are $767 for a single enrollee, $1,461 for an enrollee and one

[6:0:122,191] 6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges  

[7:0:66,212] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to  

[7:1:66,222] California's 73 community college districts, which operate 115 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed by  

[7:2:66,233] the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student  

[7:3:66,243] members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms.  

[8:0:66,263] The objectives of the Board are to:  

[8:1:65,281] • Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.  

[8:2:65,297] • Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.  

[9:0:65,313] • Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.  

[10:0:66,331] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a  

[10:1:66,341] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see  

[10:2:66,351] "Infrastructure Overview."
