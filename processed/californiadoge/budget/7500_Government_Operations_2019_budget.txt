[5:0:66,167] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,185] 6275025 - COUNTY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,206] The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human  

[7:1:66,216] resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's County  

[7:2:66,226] Assessment Standards program. This program ensures that taxable properties are enrolled and assessed, and that the 58  

[7:3:66,236] county assessors assess all properties.  

[8:0:66,254] 6275050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,272] The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human  

[9:1:66,282] resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's State-Assessed  

[9:2:66,292] Property program. This program is responsible for valuing and assessing inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used  

[9:3:66,302] by railroads, regulated telephone companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car  

[9:4:66,313] companies. Local jurisdictions use the established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes.  

[10:0:66,330] 6275075 - TIMBER TAX PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,348] This program provides revenue for the Timber Tax Fund. The revenue, less administrative costs, is allocated to the counties  

[11:1:66,358] where the timber was harvested. The CDTFA administers and collects the Timber Yield Tax, a property tax paid by timber  

[11:2:66,368] owners when they harvest trees or timber. The CDTFA determines the harvest values of timber and timberland production zone  

[11:3:66,379] values.  

[12:0:66,396] 6275100 - SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM  

[13:0:66,414] This program ensures that all sales and use tax revenues are collected in an equitable and effective manner through accurate  

[13:1:66,424] reporting of tax liability. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting errors in self-assessments, and promptly collecting  

[13:2:66,434] amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable. Under this program, the CDTFA administers the following taxes:  

[13:3:66,445] State Sales and Use Tax, Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax, and District Transactions and Use Tax (cities/ 

[13:4:66,455] counties).  

[14:0:66,472] 6275125 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TAX PROGRAM  

[15:0:66,493] These programs provide revenue for the Hazardous Waste Control Account (HWCA) and the Toxic Substances Control  

[15:1:66,503] Account (TSCA). The fees provide funding to the Department of Toxic Substances (DTSC) to regulate hazardous waste in  

[15:2:66,513] California. Generators of hazardous waste, hazardous waste facilities and certain business organizations, as identified by  

[15:3:66,523] statute, are subject to the fees. The CDTFA administers the following fee programs in partnership with the DTS: Disposal Fee  

[15:4:66,534] (HWCA), Generator Fee (HWCA), Transportable Treatment Unit Fee (HWCA), Facility Fee (HWCA), and Environmental Fee  

[15:5:66,544] (TSCA).  

[16:0:66,562] 6275150 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,579] This program provides revenue for the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. The CDTFA collects the excise tax imposed on the  

[17:1:66,589] sale, distribution, or importation of alcoholic beverages in California. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer this

[8:2:66,362] 6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,380] This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of,

[9:2:66,400] personal income tax.  

[9:3:66,418] 6300 - LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,438] This program reimburses the Department of Justice for legal services provided in support of Franchise Tax Board functions.  

[10:1:66,456] 6305 - CONTRACT WORK

[12:2:66,555] programs and services are carried out in accordance with Government Code sections 15701 and 15702. This program also

[1:0:196,43] 7760   Department of General Services  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides  

[3:0:66,74] centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and  

[3:1:66,84] construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building;  

[3:2:66,95] printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's  

[4:0:66,105] vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve  

[4:1:66,115] California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions.  

[5:0:66,135] Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support  

[5:1:66,146] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:433,13] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:161,32] 7760   Department of General Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for  

[3:1:66,79] inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in  

[3:2:66,89] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds  

[3:3:66,99] are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public  

[3:4:66,109] building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school  

[3:5:66,120] districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)  

[3:6:66,130] Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.  

[4:0:66,148] 6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[5:0:66,165] The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and  

[5:1:66,175] equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties.  

[6:0:66,193] 6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES  

[7:0:66,214] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid  

[7:1:66,224] redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate  

[7:2:66,234] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring   protection of lives and  

[7:3:66,244] property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified  

[7:4:66,254] parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their  

[7:5:66,265] programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies,  

[7:6:66,275] and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and  

[7:7:66,285] ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners.  

[8:0:66,303] 6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES  

[9:0:66,323] To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are  

[9:1:66,333] essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and  

[9:2:66,343] leveraged procurement agreements for   information   technology   and non-information technology   goods and services, green and  

[9:3:66,354] sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing  

[9:4:66,364] small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing  

[9:5:66,374] the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include  

[9:6:66,384] travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy  

[9:7:66,394] efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human resources services.  

[9:8:66,405] Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct quasi-judicial hearings  

[9:9:66,415] and mediations authorized by law.  

[10:0:66,433] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[11:0:66,453] The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This  

[11:1:66,463] program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services,  

[11:2:66,473] auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative  

[11:3:66,484] services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training,   information technology, health and safety, and

[3:0:66,88] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,106] 6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,127] This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer  

[4:1:66,137] financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a  

[4:2:66,147] claim with the CalVCB for program benefits.  

[4:3:66,165] 6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,185] This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery  

[5:1:66,195] of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community  

[5:2:66,205] (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition  

[5:3:66,216] and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,  

[5:4:66,226] the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.

[1:0:178,43] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System  

[2:0:66,64] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers retirement benefits for about 1,958,000 active  

[2:1:66,74] employees and retirees of state and local agencies in California as of June 30, 2018. Benefits include retirement, disability, and  

[2:2:66,84] survivor retirement benefits.  

[3:0:66,105] CalPERS provides health benefits for approximately 1,462,000 active and retired state, local government, and school  

[3:1:66,115] employees and their family members as of June 30, 2018. CalPERS develops, negotiates, and administers contracts with  

[4:0:66,125] health maintenance organizations, group hospitals, and medical insurance plans. In addition, CalPERS administers a long-term  

[4:1:66,135] care program for members and eligible individuals.  

[5:0:66,156] CalPERS is governed by a Board of Administration. The California Constitution provides that the CalPERS Board of

[12:0:66,617] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[12:1:65,635] • The Budget includes an estimated   $6.8 billion contribution ($3.9 billion General Fund) to the CalPERS state retirement plans,  

[12:2:76,646] as required by statute.   The $569 million estimated increase ($328 million General Fund)   from the previous fiscal year is due  

[12:3:76,656] to   (1) the normal progression of the existing amortization and smoothing policy, (2) the CalPERS Board's action in 2016 to  

[12:4:76,666] lower the assumed rate of return for the system, and (3) increases in payroll. The assumption change increased the system's  

[12:5:76,676] liabilities, resulting in an increase to the state's funding obligation. The reduction in the assumed rate of return, from 7.5 to 7  

[12:6:76,686] percent, is being phased in over three years; this is the third and final year of the phase-in.  

[13:0:65,703] • The Budget includes $2.5 billion General Fund in 2018-19, as the first installment of a $3.0 billion payment to be paid  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:143,32] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:76,69] towards the unfunded liabilities of the CalPERS state retirement plans in fiscal years 2018-19, 2020-21, 2021-22, and  

[3:1:76,79] 2022-23. This is a supplemental payment in addition to the estimated $6.2 billion contribution that the state is statutorily-

[3:2:76,89] required to make to CalPERS in 2018-19.  

[4:0:65,105] • The Budget includes a $904 million General Fund payment in 2018-19 to be paid to the CalPERS Schools Pool. Of this  

[4:1:76,115] amount, roughly $244 million will supplant school employer contributions to the CalPERS Schools Pool over the next two  

[4:2:76,126] fiscal years, reducing the contribution rate by 1.012 percent in 2019-20 and by 0.70 percent in 2020-21. The remaining $660  

[4:3:76,136] million will be paid towards the unfunded liability for the CalPERS Schools Pool.  

[4:4:65,152] • Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $390 million within the  

[4:5:76,162] Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s portion of a loan from the Surplus Money  

[4:6:76,172] Investment Fund authorized in Chapter 50, Statutes of 2017 (SB 84). This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental  

[4:7:76,183] pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement plans in 2017-18.  

[5:0:65,199] • The Budget brings the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Revolving Fund (OASI Fund) under the budget-approval process to  

[5:1:76,209] ensure administrative oversight and provide better insight and transparency into the State Social Security Administrator  

[5:2:76,219] program and OASI Fund.

[15:1:112,349] 2019-20 Governor's Budget to the 2019 Budget Act reflects an increase in the five state plans' employer contribution rates, with the

[1:0:433,13] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:143,32] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,94] 6410 - RETIREMENT  

[5:0:66,115] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for  

[5:1:66,125] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of  

[5:2:66,135] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2018, there were about 1,263,000 active and inactive members, and  

[5:3:66,145] about 695,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.  

[6:0:66,166] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  

[6:1:66,176] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,  

[6:2:66,186] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract  

[6:3:66,196] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit  

[6:4:66,207] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.  

[7:0:66,227] As of June 30, 2018, there were 2,892 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and  

[7:1:66,237] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their  

[7:2:66,247] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency  

[7:3:66,258] retirement systems.  

[8:0:66,278] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.  

[9:0:66,296] 6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY  

[10:0:66,316] CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the  

[10:1:66,326] federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age,  

[10:2:66,337] Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.   As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the  

[10:3:66,347] liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.   The program is responsible for  

[10:4:66,357] administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting  

[10:5:66,367] and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 

[11:0:66,385] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS  

[12:0:66,405] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee  

[12:1:66,415] associations, and others to provide health and long-term care insurance for state, California State University, and local public  

[12:2:66,426] agency employees, retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-

[12:3:66,436] effective programs, provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee  

[12:4:66,446] organizations and employer representatives.  

[13:0:66,466] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,  

[13:1:66,477] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all  

[13:2:66,487] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial  

[13:3:66,497] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.  

[14:0:66,515] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS  

[15:0:66,535] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the  

[15:1:66,545] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired  

[15:2:66,556] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'  

[15:3:66,566] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $358.0 billion, as of June 30, 2018.  

[16:0:66,583] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,604] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of  

[17:1:66,614] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy  

[17:2:66,624] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Operational  

[17:3:66,634] Support, and Public Affairs.

[1:0:206,43] 7910   Office of Administrative Law  

[2:0:66,64] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state  

[2:1:66,74] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these  

[2:2:66,84] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also  

[2:3:66,95] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been  

[2:4:66,105] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through  

[2:5:66,115] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative  

[2:6:66,125] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members  

[2:7:66,135] of the public regarding California rulemaking law.  

[3:0:66,156] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies  

[3:1:66,166] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the  

[3:2:66,176] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.  

[4:0:66,197] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the  

[4:1:66,207] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[1:0:187,43] 7920   State Teachers' Retirement System  

[2:0:66,64] The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution  

[2:1:66,74] plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred  

[2:2:66,84] compensation plans and programs:  

[2:3:65,102] • State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP)  

[3:0:65,118] • CalSTRS Pension2 Program (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans)  

[3:1:65,135] • Teachers' Health Benefits Fund  

[3:2:65,151] • Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund  

[4:0:66,168] CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school  

[4:1:66,179] teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of  

[4:2:66,189] June 30, 2018, there are approximately 949,000 members, retirees, and beneficiaries of the STRP Defined Benefit Program.  

[5:0:66,209] CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement  

[5:1:66,219] Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

[11:0:66,532] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[11:1:65,550] • The Budget includes $3.3 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The roughly $241 million increase from  

[11:2:76,560] the previous fiscal year is due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its authority to  

[11:3:76,571] increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law in 2014.  

[11:4:65,587] • The Budget includes $4.0 million and 7 positions for enterprise compliance, litigation, and investment engagement activities.  

[11:5:76,597] In addition, this will provide funding for external auditors to perform an annual independent audit of CalSTRS financial  

[11:6:76,607] statements. These resources will enable CalSTRS to strategically manage operational, financial, legal, and reputational risks  

[11:7:76,617] of the organization.  

[12:0:65,634] • Although not reflected in 7920 - State Teachers' Retirement System, the Budget includes a $2.25 billion supplemental  

[12:1:76,644] pension payment to CalSTRS in 2018-19 on behalf of school employers, and a $2.9 billion supplemental pension payment  

[12:2:76,654] spread over four years to be paid towards the state's share of the unfunded liability for the CalSTRS Defined Benefit  

[12:3:76,664] Program. See 6300 - State Contribution to the State Teachers' Retirement System for more information.

[3:0:66,76] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,94] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS  

[4:0:66,115] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the  

[4:1:66,125] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the  

[4:2:66,135] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement  

[4:3:66,145] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may  

[4:4:66,156] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the  

[4:5:66,166] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's  

[4:6:66,176] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or  

[4:7:66,186] contract provisions.  

[5:0:66,207] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the  

[5:1:66,217] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of  

[5:2:66,227] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
