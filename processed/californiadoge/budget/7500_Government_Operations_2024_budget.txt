[5:1:66,113] resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's County  

[5:2:66,123] Assessment Standards program. This program ensures that taxable properties are enrolled and assessed, and that the 58  

[5:3:66,133] county assessors assess all properties.  

[6:0:66,150] 6275050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,167] The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human  

[7:1:66,177] resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's State-Assessed  

[7:2:66,187] Property program. This program is responsible for valuing and assessing inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used  

[7:3:66,196] by railroads, regulated telephone companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car  

[7:4:66,206] companies. Local jurisdictions use the established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes.  

[8:0:66,224] 6275075 - TIMBER TAX PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,241] This program provides revenue for the Timber Tax Fund. The revenue, less administrative costs, is allocated to the counties  

[9:1:66,251] where the timber was harvested. The CDTFA administers and collects the Timber Yield Tax, a property tax paid by timber  

[9:2:66,260] owners when they harvest trees or timber. The CDTFA determines the harvest values of timber and timberland production zone  

[9:3:66,270] values.  

[10:0:66,287] 6275100 - SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,305] This program ensures that all sales and use tax revenues are collected in an equitable and effective manner through accurate  

[11:1:66,314] reporting of tax liability. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting errors in self-assessments, and promptly collecting  

[11:2:66,324] amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable. Under this program, the CDTFA administers the following taxes:  

[11:3:66,334] State Sales and Use Tax, Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax, and District Transactions and Use Tax (cities/ 

[11:4:66,344] counties).  

[12:0:66,361] 6275125 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TAX PROGRAM  

[13:0:66,378] These programs provide revenue for the Hazardous Waste Control Account (HWCA), the Hazardous Waste Facilities Account  

[13:1:66,388] (HWFA), and the Toxic Substances Control Account (TSCA). The fees provide funding to the Department of Toxic Substances  

[13:2:66,398] Control (DTSC) to regulate hazardous waste in California. Generators of hazardous waste, hazardous waste facilities and  

[13:3:66,408] certain business organizations, as identified by statute, are subject to the fees. CDTFA administers the following fee programs  

[13:4:66,417] in partnership with DTSC: Disposal Fee (HWCA), Generator Fee/Generation and Handling Fee (HWCA), Transportable  

[13:5:66,427] Treatment Unit Fee (HWCA), Facility Fee (HWCA-HWFA), and Environmental Fee (TSCA).  

[14:0:66,444] 6275150 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM  

[15:0:66,462] This program provides revenue for the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. The CDTFA collects the excise tax imposed on the  

[15:1:66,472] sale, distribution, or importation of alcoholic beverages in California. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to provide  

[15:2:66,481] Administrative services for this program.  

[16:0:66,499] 6275175 - TIRE RECYCLING FEE PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,516] This program provides revenue for the California Tire Recycling Account in the California Tire Recycling Management Fund  

[17:1:66,526] and Air Pollution Control Fund. The fee provides funding to reduce air pollution, landfill disposal, and stockpiling of used tires.  

[17:2:66,535] The CDTFA administers the program in partnership with the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, and  

[17:3:66,545] the Air Resources Board.  

[18:0:66,562] 6275200 - CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS TAX PROGRAM  

[19:0:66,582] This program provides revenue for the Cigarette Tax Fund, Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund, California  

[19:1:66,592] Healthcare, Research and Prevention Tobacco Tax Act of 2016 Fund, the Breast Cancer Fund, and the California Children and  

[19:2:66,602] Families First Trust Fund. The program objective is to ensure that the excise tax imposed on all cigarette and tobacco products  

[19:3:66,611] are collected equitably and effectively by ensuring timely reporting and payment of tax liabilities, detecting and correcting  

[19:4:66,621] reporting errors, and promptly collecting amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable.  

[20:0:66,638] 6275225 - CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS LICENSING PROGRAM  

[21:0:66,658] This program provides revenue for the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Compliance Fund, which is used to implement, enforce,  

[21:1:66,668] and administer the provisions of the California Cigarette and Tobacco Licensing Act of 2003. The Licensing Act required the  

[21:2:66,677] CDTFA to establish a statewide licensure program to help stem the tide of untaxed distributions and illegal sales   of cigarette  

[21:3:66,687] and tobacco products and stamps. This program requires licensing of distributors, wholesalers, importers, manufacturers, and  

[21:4:66,697] retailers of cigarette and tobacco products.  

[22:0:66,714] 6275250 - TRANSPORTATION FUND TAX PROGRAM

[3:1:66,78] Account, Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund, Off-Highway Vehicle Trust Fund, Highway Users Tax Fund, and Department  

[3:2:66,88] of Food and Agriculture Fund. The objective of this program is to ensure that the motor vehicle fuel, jet fuel, various use fuel,

[6:0:66,198] The mission of the Department of General Services (DGS) is to deliver results by providing timely, cost-effective services and  

[6:1:66,208] products that support their customers, while protecting the interests of the State of California.  

[7:0:66,225] DGS serves as the business manager for the State of California, with more than 4,400 employees and a budget of more than  

[7:1:66,235] $1.3 billion. DGS serves the public by providing a variety of services to state agencies through procurement and acquisition  

[7:2:66,245] solutions; real estate management and design; environmentally friendly transportation; professional printing, design and web  

[7:3:66,255] services; administrative hearings; legal services; building standards; oversight of structural safety, fire/life safety and  

[8:0:66,264] accessibility for the design and construction of K-12 public schools and community colleges; funding for school construction;  

[8:1:66,274] and disability access.  

[9:0:66,291] Because DGS's programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, DGS has a capital outlay program to support this need.

[5:0:66,226] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,245] 6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES  

[7:0:66,262] With a multi-billion-dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for  

[7:1:66,272] inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in  

[7:2:66,282] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds  

[7:3:66,291] are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public  

[7:4:66,301] building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school  

[7:5:66,311] districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)  

[7:6:66,321] Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.  

[8:0:66,338] 6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[9:0:66,355] The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and  

[9:1:66,365] equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties.  

[10:0:66,382] 6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES  

[11:0:66,400] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid  

[11:1:66,409] redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate  

[11:2:66,419] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring   protection of lives and  

[11:3:66,429] property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified  

[11:4:66,439] parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their  

[11:5:66,448] programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies,  

[11:6:66,458] and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and  

[11:7:66,468] ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners.  

[12:0:66,485] 6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES  

[13:0:66,503] To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are  

[13:1:66,512] essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and  

[13:2:66,522] leveraged procurement agreements for   information   technology   and non-information technology   goods and services, green and  

[13:3:66,532] sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing  

[13:4:66,542] small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing  

[13:5:66,551] the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include  

[13:6:66,561] travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy  

[13:7:66,571] efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, telework compliance, and budget, accounting, and human  

[13:8:66,581] resources services. Additionally, state, and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct  

[13:9:66,590] quasi-judicial hearings and mediations authorized by law.  

[14:0:66,608] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[15:0:66,625] The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This  

[15:1:66,635] program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services,  

[15:2:66,645] auditing, research, and strategic planning, public affairs, and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative  

[15:3:66,654] services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training,   information technology, health and safety, and  

[15:4:66,664] departmental procurement and contracting.

[3:0:66,69] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[4:0:66,87] DGS is responsible for managing approximately 36.9 million square feet of space that supports a variety of state programs and  

[4:1:66,97] functions. Of this amount, 13.1 million net usable square feet is attributable to 59 DGS-managed state office buildings including  

[4:2:66,107] the State Capitol and three new office buildings (Clifford L. Allenby and Natural Resources Agency Headquarters, and the 10th  

[4:3:66,117] and O Street State Office Building); 2.4 million gross square feet related to 24 other state-owned buildings including a new  

[4:4:66,127] childcare facility, warehouses, storage, the Central Heating and Cooling Plant, parking structures, and the State Records  

[4:5:66,136] Warehouse; and 21.4 million net usable square feet is associated with DGS-managed commercial leases of all space types.  

[4:6:66,146] Additionally, the Richards Boulevard Office Complex will add over one million square feet to DGS’s office building portfolio upon  

[4:7:66,156] completion in Spring 2024, at which time it will be added to the Statewide Property Inventory. Finally, DGS has jurisdiction over  

[4:8:66,166] retail and residential properties in downtown Sacramento that the Capitol Area Development Authority manages directly.

[5:0:66,344] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,363] 6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,382] This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer  

[6:1:66,392] financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a  

[6:2:66,402] claim with the CalVCB for program benefits.  

[6:3:66,419] 6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,439] This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery  

[7:1:66,449] of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community  

[7:2:66,458] (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition  

[7:3:66,468] and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,  

[7:4:66,478] the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.  

[7:5:66,495] 6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,515] This program reimburses persons who sustained injury for certain expenses or losses as a result of a direct action that  

[8:1:66,524] benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

[14:0:103,400] 2/  This display does not reflect the $337 million supplemental pension payment to the California Public Employees'  

[14:1:103,411] Retirement System (CalPERS) in 2024-25 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in  

[14:2:103,420] the 2024 Budget Act.  

[15:0:103,442] 3/  The 2024 Budget Act estimates 2024-25 state contributions to CalPERS to be $6,251,040,000. The decrease in this  

[15:1:103,453] estimate from the 2024-25 Governor's Budget to the 2024 Budget Act is due to the integration of CalPERS valuation results

[16:2:103,517] 2024 Budget Act reflects reductions in software, data software, and consulting expenses. 

[17:0:103,543] 5/  The 2024 Budget Act estimates 2024-25 other expenditures to be $1,574,787,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of

[1:0:433,13] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:143,32] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 6410 - RETIREMENT  

[5:0:66,101] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for  

[5:1:66,111] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of  

[5:2:66,121] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2023, there were about 1,445,000 active and inactive members, and  

[5:3:66,130] about 789,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.  

[6:0:66,148] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  

[6:1:66,157] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,  

[6:2:66,167] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract  

[6:3:66,177] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit  

[6:4:66,187] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.  

[7:0:66,204] As of June 30, 2023, there were 2,888 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and  

[7:1:66,214] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their  

[7:2:66,224] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency  

[7:3:66,233] retirement systems.  

[8:0:66,251] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.  

[9:0:66,268] 6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY  

[10:0:66,287] CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the  

[10:1:66,297] federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age,  

[10:2:66,307] Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act. As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the  

[10:3:66,317] liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies. The program is responsible for  

[10:4:66,327] administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting  

[10:5:66,336] and reporting information to the Social Security Administration.  

[11:0:66,354] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS  

[12:0:66,371] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee  

[12:1:66,381] associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees,  

[12:2:66,390] retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs,  

[12:3:66,400] provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer  

[12:4:66,410] representatives.  

[13:0:66,427] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,  

[13:1:66,437] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all  

[13:2:66,447] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial  

[13:3:66,457] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.  

[14:0:66,474] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS  

[15:0:66,493] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the  

[15:1:66,503] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired  

[15:2:66,513] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'  

[15:3:66,523] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $464.6 billion, as of June 30, 2023.  

[16:0:66,540] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,557] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of  

[17:1:66,567] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy  

[17:2:66,577] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term  

[17:3:66,587] Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

[8:0:206,354] 7910   Office of Administrative Law  

[9:0:66,375] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state  

[9:1:66,385] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these  

[9:2:66,395] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also  

[9:3:66,404] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been  

[9:4:66,414] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through  

[9:5:66,424] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative  

[9:6:66,434] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members  

[9:7:66,444] of the public regarding California rulemaking law.  

[10:0:66,463] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies  

[10:1:66,473] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the  

[10:2:66,483] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.  

[11:0:66,502] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the  

[11:1:66,512] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[10:0:187,495] 7920   State Teachers' Retirement System  

[11:0:66,516] The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution  

[11:1:66,526] plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred  

[11:2:66,536] compensation plans and programs:  

[11:3:65,553] • State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP)  

[12:0:65,569] • CalSTRS Pension2 Personal Wealth Plan (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans)  

[12:1:65,585] • Teachers' Health Benefits Fund  

[12:2:65,601] • Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund  

[13:0:66,618] CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school  

[13:1:66,628] teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of  

[13:2:66,637] June 30, 2023, there were over one million members, retirees, and beneficiaries in the STRP Defined Benefit Program.  

[14:0:66,657] CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement  

[14:1:66,667] Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS  

[4:0:66,103] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the  

[4:1:66,113] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the  

[4:2:66,123] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement  

[4:3:66,133] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may  

[4:4:66,142] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the  

[4:5:66,152] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's  

[4:6:66,162] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or  

[4:7:66,172] contract provisions.  

[5:0:66,191] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the  

[5:1:66,201] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of  

[5:2:66,211] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
