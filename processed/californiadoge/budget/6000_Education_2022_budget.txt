[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2022-23 STATE BUDGET — EDU   1 

[1:0:216,39] 6100   Department of Education  

[2:0:66,61] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of  

[2:1:66,71] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6 million  

[3:0:66,81] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Operations and Administration Branch;  

[3:1:66,91] the Opportunities for All Branch; the Equity Branch; the Information and Technology Branch; the Instruction, Measurement and  

[3:2:66,101] Administration Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch.  

[4:0:66,119] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to  

[4:1:66,129] work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding  

[5:0:66,139] local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity in  

[5:1:66,150] utilizing a process of continual improvement that enables all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and  

[6:0:66,160] improving a system of recruiting, developing, and supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool  

[6:1:66,170] through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning,  

[6:2:66,180] (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good  

[6:3:66,190] financial management practices, (f) providing broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district,  

[7:0:66,201] county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical,  

[7:1:66,211] emotional, and intellectual support to help students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i)  

[7:2:66,221] providing statewide leadership that promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to  

[7:3:66,231] serve students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department.  

[8:0:66,249] Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[8:1:66,259] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[9:1:66,412] K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of  

[9:2:66,422] substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory  

[9:3:66,433] timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits, including Local School Construction Bond Audits, School Facility  

[9:4:66,443] Program Bond Fund Audits, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program Audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear  

[9:5:66,453] standards for compliance with education funding requirements, and allow both the state and local educational agencies to  

[9:6:66,463] avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over disputed funding.

[15:1:66,698] creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an  

[15:2:66,708] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on

[2:0:77,32] 6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three  

[3:1:66,79] years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase  

[3:2:66,89] the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.  

[4:0:66,107] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in  

[4:1:66,117] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing  

[4:2:66,127] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection  

[4:3:66,137] payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to  

[4:4:66,148] set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to  

[4:5:66,158] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an  

[4:6:66,168] amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding  

[4:7:66,178] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15  

[4:8:66,188] of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’  

[4:9:66,199] Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)  

[4:10:66,209] increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[10:0:66,495] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[11:0:66,514] • The Budget includes $3.7 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS in 2022-23. The decrease in funding for the  

[11:1:66,525] Defined Benefit Plan from the previous fiscal year is largely due to an additional $174 million one-time General Fund payment  

[11:2:66,535] in 2021-22. The Teachers’ Retirement Board did not exercise its authority to increase the state contribution rate by up to 0.5  

[11:3:66,545] percent of teacher payroll in 2022-23 due to the higher than expected investment return in 2020-21 and CalSTRS' current  

[11:4:66,555] projections that the state’s share of unfunded actuarial obligation will be eliminated by 2024-25.

[5:0:202,207] 6350   School Facilities Aid Program  

[6:0:66,228] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities  

[6:1:66,238] such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.   The programs are administered by the State Allocation  

[6:2:66,249] Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 

[7:0:66,269] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility  

[7:1:66,279] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in  

[7:2:66,289] statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.   These funds primarily  

[7:3:66,300] support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through  

[7:4:66,310] the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding  

[7:5:66,320] relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7)  

[7:6:66,330] seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general  

[7:7:66,340] obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3  

[7:8:66,351] billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical  

[7:9:66,361] education projects.  

[8:0:66,378] The 2022 Budget Act amended Education Code Section 17375 and provided one-time General Fund for the California  

[9:0:66,389] Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program. The program allows school districts  

[9:1:66,399] that lack the facilities to provide California preschool, transitional kindergarten and full-day kindergarten to apply for one-time  

[9:2:66,409] grants to construct new school facilities or retrofit existing school facilities for the purpose of expanding these programs. The  

[9:3:66,419] program is also administered by the State Allocation Board.

[5:0:221,192] 6440   University of California  

[6:0:66,213] The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic  

[6:1:66,223] programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service.  

[7:0:66,241] The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of  

[7:1:66,251] 1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the UC. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 members:  

[7:2:66,261] 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, and 1 student  

[7:3:66,271] appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents.  

[8:0:66,289] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. The  

[8:1:66,299] UC also serves students at all levels of higher education in California and serves as the public segment primarily responsible  

[8:2:66,310] for awarding doctoral degrees and and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law.  

[9:0:66,327] There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa  

[9:1:66,337] Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.  

[9:2:66,348] The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and  

[9:3:66,358] administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States  

[9:4:66,368] Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories.  

[9:5:66,386] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource  

[9:6:66,396] allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated  

[9:7:66,406] authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.  

[10:0:66,424] Because UC’s programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, UC has a capital outlay program to support this need. For  

[10:1:66,434] the specifics on UC's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview.”

[10:0:66,398] Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, was approved by California voters on November 2, 2004,  

[10:1:66,408] providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for stem cell research conducted at California universities, research  

[10:2:66,418] institutions, and companies. It also established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to make grants and loans for  

[10:3:66,428] stem cell research. The Institute's mission is to accelerate world class science to deliver transformative regenerative medicine  

[10:4:66,439] treatments to a diverse California and worldwide in an equitable manner.  

[10:5:66,456] Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research Institute Bond Initiative that was approved by California voters on November 8, 2020,  

[10:6:66,466] authorized $5.5 billion in new general obligation bonds and increased the Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee from 29  

[10:7:66,477] to 35 members, among other administrative and oversight changes.   Proposition 14 also requires that revenues generated  

[10:8:66,487] through licensing or self-commercializing an invention or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM be used to  

[10:9:66,497] offset the costs of providing treatments and cures arising from CIRM-funded research to California patients who have  

[10:10:66,507] insufficient means to purchase such treatment or cure, including the reimbursement of patient-qualified costs for research  

[10:11:66,517] participants.  

[11:0:66,535] The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 35-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public  

[11:1:66,545] officials appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research  

[11:2:66,556] institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.

[1:0:212,69] 6610   California State University  

[1:1:66,91] The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate  

[1:2:66,101] instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal arts education programs. For undergraduate programs, each  

[1:3:66,111] campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-

[1:4:66,121] level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in audiology, education, nursing practice, occupational  

[1:5:66,131] therapy, and physical therapy. The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with  

[1:6:66,142] private institutions.  

[2:0:66,159] The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16  

[2:1:66,169] members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student  

[2:2:66,180] representatives and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year term by the CSU Alumni  

[2:3:66,190] Council. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents  

[2:4:66,200] develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses,  

[2:5:66,210] recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor.  

[2:6:66,228] The CSU’s goals include to:

[5:1:76,315] study.

[5:0:164,142] 6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants  

[5:1:66,163] This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their  

[5:2:66,174] dependents.  

[6:0:66,194] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan.  

[6:1:66,204] Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed.  

[7:0:66,225] The 2021-22 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established  

[7:1:66,235] in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members  

[7:2:66,245] hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest  

[7:3:66,255] health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also  

[7:4:66,265] contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents.  

[8:0:66,286] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[8:1:66,296] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2021 monthly contribution  

[8:2:66,306] maximums are $798 for a single enrollee, $1,519 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,937 for an enrollee and two or  

[8:3:66,316] more dependents. The 2022 monthly contribution maximums are $816 for a single enrollee, $1,548 for an enrollee and one  

[8:4:66,327] dependent, and $1,983 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

[6:0:122,216] 6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges  

[7:0:66,237] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to  

[7:1:66,247] California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 18 voting members as  

[7:2:66,258] specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-year terms, and must  

[7:3:66,268] include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-year terms and  

[7:4:66,278] include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of  

[7:5:66,288] the Board.  

[8:0:66,306] The objectives of the Board are to:  

[9:0:66,324] • Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.  

[10:0:66,334] • Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.  

[11:0:66,344] • Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.  

[12:0:66,362] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a  

[12:1:66,372] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see
