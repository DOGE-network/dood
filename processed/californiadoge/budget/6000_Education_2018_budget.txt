[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2018-19 STATE BUDGET — EDU   1 

[1:0:216,43] 6100   Department of Education 

[2:0:66,64] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 

[2:1:66,74] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million 

[3:0:66,84] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Systems Support Branch; the Teaching 

[3:1:66,95] and Learning Support Branch; the Performance, Planning, and Technology Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch. 

[4:0:66,112] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to 

[4:1:66,123] work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding 

[5:0:66,133] local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to 

[5:1:66,143] enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and 

[6:0:66,153] supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that 

[6:1:66,163] promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the 

[7:0:66,174] administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing 

[8:0:66,184] broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering 

[8:1:66,194] systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help 

[8:2:66,204] students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that 

[9:0:66,214] promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the 

[9:1:66,225] effectiveness and efficiency of the Department. 

[10:0:66,242] Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 

[10:1:66,252] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 

[10:2:66,263] Overview."

[1:0:198,43] 6125   Education Audit Appeals Panel 

[2:0:66,64] The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by 

[2:1:66,74] K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of 

[2:2:66,84] substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory 

[2:3:66,95] timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear standards for compliance with education 

[2:4:66,105] funding requirements, and allow both the state and local educational agencies to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over

[1:0:112,43] 6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System 

[2:0:66,64] The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 

[3:0:66,84] The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members' 

[3:1:66,95] creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an 

[3:2:66,105] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on 

[3:3:66,115] July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469) increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three 

[3:4:66,125] years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The   Teachers' Retirement   Board can increase 

[3:5:66,135] the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 

[4:0:66,156] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 

[4:1:66,166] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 

[4:2:66,176] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389) increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection 

[4:3:66,186] payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The   Teachers' Retirement   Board is required to 

[4:4:66,197] set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 

[4:5:66,207] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an 

[4:6:66,217] amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 

[4:7:66,227] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15 

[4:8:66,237] of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the   Teachers' 

[4:9:66,248] Retirement   Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) 

[4:10:66,258] increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[12:0:66,520] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[13:0:65,538] •   The Budget includes $3.1 billion General Fund   for state contributions to CalSTRS.   This roughly $300 million year-over-year 

[13:1:76,548] increase is due to an unanticipated increase in payroll growth, and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its 

[13:2:76,559] authority to increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law 

[13:3:76,569] in 2014. The Teachers' Retirement Board adopted changes in demographic and economic assumptions in 2017, which 

[13:4:76,579] resulted in an increase to the system's liabilities, thereby increasing the state's funding obligation.

[1:0:202,43] 6350   School Facilities Aid Program 

[2:0:66,64] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 

[2:1:66,74] such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs. 

[3:0:66,92] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 

[3:1:66,102] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Proposition 1D, approved in November 2006, provided State General 

[3:2:66,112] Obligation Bonds of $5.2 billion to local educational agencies for new construction and modernization projects. Further, 

[3:3:66,123] Proposition 1D provided $2.1 billion for Charter Schools, Career Technical Education Facilities, Overcrowding Relief, High 

[3:4:66,133] Performance Incentive Grants, and Joint-Use projects. The SFP also contains provisions for Critically Overcrowded Schools 

[3:5:66,143] and Seismic Mitigation. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, extends the existing SFP and authorized a total 

[3:6:66,153] of $7 billion in State General Obligation Bonds for local educational agencies school construction projects. These funds will be 

[3:7:66,163] allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million 

[3:8:66,174] for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical education projects.

[5:0:66,416] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:1:66,435] 5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 

[6:0:66,452] This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 

[6:1:66,462] a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 

[6:2:66,480] The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 241,000 applications annually for 

[6:3:66,490] credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 

[6:4:66,501] primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 

[6:5:66,511] personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 

[6:6:66,528] The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 

[6:7:66,539] aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 

[6:8:66,549] the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, and (3) supporting the Commission with analysis 

[6:9:66,559] and development of policy. The Division supports the Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with 

[6:10:66,569] implementing the Commission's accreditation system to monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The 

[6:11:66,579] accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site 

[6:12:66,590] visit activities. Related activities include initial program approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is 

[6:13:66,600] also responsible for monitoring certificated assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 

[6:14:66,618] The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 

[6:15:66,628] advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 

[6:16:66,638] Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and 

[6:17:66,648] applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 

[6:18:66,658] disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 

[6:19:66,676] 5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES

[0:0:66,13] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — EDU   52   EDUCATION 

[1:0:221,43] 6440   University of California 

[2:0:66,64] The University of California (UC) provides higher education through (1) instruction in undergraduate, graduate, and 

[3:0:66,74] professional degree programs and postdoctoral programs; (2) research; (3) education for professional careers; and (4) public 

[3:1:66,84] service. 

[4:0:66,102] The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 

[4:1:66,112] 1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the 

[4:2:66,123] following 26 members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 

[4:3:66,133] 12-year terms, and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 

[5:0:66,150] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates the UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. 

[5:1:66,161] In addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment primarily 

[5:2:66,171] responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 

[6:0:66,189] There are ten UC campuses as follows: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, 

[6:1:66,199] Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses and offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional 

[6:2:66,209] education. The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching 

[7:0:66,219] hospitals in the counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange. The university administers more 

[7:1:66,229] than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. The university provides oversight of one United States 

[8:0:66,240] Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 

[9:0:66,257] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 

[9:1:66,267] allocation. The 10 chancellors are responsible for management of individual campuses. The Regents have delegated authority 

[9:2:66,278] to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

[1:0:207,43] 6600   Hastings College of the Law 

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (Hastings) is to train students for the legal profession 

[2:1:66,74] with a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the law. Hastings was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton Hastings, 

[2:2:66,84] the first Chief Justice of the State of California. The Legislature provided for affiliation with the University of California. Hastings 

[2:3:66,95] is the oldest law school and one of the largest public law schools in the United States. The business of the college is managed 

[2:4:66,105] by the Board of Directors. The Board has 11 directors: one is an heir or representative of S.C. Hastings and the other 10 are 

[2:5:66,115] appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. Directors serve for 12-year terms. Hastings is approved by the 

[2:6:66,125] American Bar Association and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western 

[2:7:66,135] Association of Schools and Colleges. Hastings is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. The Juris Doctor 

[2:8:66,146] degree is granted by the Regents of the University of California and is signed by the President of the University of California 

[2:9:66,156] and the Chancellor and Dean of Hastings College of the Law. 

[3:0:66,174] Because Hastings' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Hastings has a capital outlay program to support this 

[3:1:66,184] need. For the specifics on Hastings' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,91] 5530 - This program provides support for the College. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 

[4:1:66,108] INSTRUCTION 

[5:0:66,126] Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 

[5:1:66,136] profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 

[5:2:66,154] The principal objectives are to (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal 

[5:3:66,164] profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students 

[5:4:66,174] with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments on legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of 

[5:5:66,185] professionalism for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and 

[5:6:66,195] responsibilities of lawyers in overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 

[5:7:66,212] ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 

[6:0:66,230] The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference 

[6:1:66,240] and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom 

[6:2:66,251] presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, and legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The 

[6:3:66,261] law library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 

[6:4:66,278] STUDENT SERVICES 

[7:0:66,296] Student services includes admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support 

[7:1:66,306] Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide 

[7:2:66,317] students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist 

[7:3:66,327] students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment opportunities. 

[7:4:66,337] These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support Program 

[7:5:66,347] (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other services to 

[7:6:66,357] supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 

[7:7:66,375] INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 

[8:0:66,393] Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety, 

[8:1:66,403] community relations, and administrative services. 

[8:2:66,421] OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 

[9:0:66,438] Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 

[9:1:66,449] administration of maintenance and renovation activities of the college's plant. 

[9:2:66,466] EXTRAMURAL 

[10:0:66,484] Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These

[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2018-19 STATE BUDGET — EDU   85 

[1:0:212,43] 6610   California State University 

[2:0:66,64] The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate 

[2:1:66,74] instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs. For undergraduate programs, each campus 

[2:2:66,84] requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-level 

[2:3:66,95] graduate programs, the CSU offers doctorate programs in education, nursing practice, and physical therapy. The CSU also 

[2:4:66,105] offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 

[3:0:66,125] The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16 

[3:1:66,135] members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, and 4 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 

[3:2:66,146] student representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, 1 faculty representative, and 1 alumni representative). The Trustees appoint 

[3:3:66,156] the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy. The 

[3:4:66,166] systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to 

[3:5:66,176] the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 

[4:0:66,197] The program goals include: 

[4:1:65,214] •   Providing instruction in the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, applied fields that require more than two years of 

[4:2:76,225] college education, and teacher education. 

[4:3:65,241] •   Providing public services to the people of California. 

[4:4:65,257] •   Providing services to students enrolled in the university. 

[5:0:65,273] •   Preparing administrative leaders for elementary and secondary schools and community colleges by awarding the doctorate 

[5:1:76,283] degree in education. 

[6:0:65,300] •   Preparing physical therapists by awarding the doctorate degree in physical therapy. 

[7:0:65,316] •   Preparing faculty to teach in postsecondary nursing programs by awarding the doctorate degree in nursing practice. 

[7:1:66,333] Because the California State University's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CSU has a capital outlay 

[7:2:66,344] program to support this need. For the specifics on the CSU's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:164,43] 6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 

[2:0:66,64] This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 

[2:1:66,74] dependents. 

[3:0:66,95] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health 

[3:1:66,105] plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 

[4:0:66,125] The 2017-18 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established 

[4:1:66,135] in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members 

[4:2:66,146] hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest 

[4:3:66,156] health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also 

[4:4:66,166] contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. 

[5:0:66,186] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 

[5:1:66,197] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2017 monthly contribution 

[5:2:66,207] maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or 

[5:3:66,217] more dependents. The 2018 monthly contribution maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one 

[5:4:66,227] dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

[1:0:122,43] 6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 

[2:0:66,64] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 

[3:0:66,74] California's 72 community college districts, which operate 114 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed by 

[3:1:66,84] the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student 

[3:2:66,95] members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms. 

[3:3:66,112] The objectives of the Board are to: 

[4:0:65,130] •   Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 

[5:0:65,146] •   Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 

[6:0:65,162] •   Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 

[7:0:66,180] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 

[7:1:66,190] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 

[7:2:66,201] "Infrastructure Overview."
