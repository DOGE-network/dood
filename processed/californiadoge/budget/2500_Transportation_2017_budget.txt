[8:0:58,339] 1830019 - AERONAUTICS 

[9:0:58,357] The Division of Aeronautics supports California's aviation activities by promoting the safe and effective use of airports and 

[9:1:58,366] heliports. This program oversees safety compliance and provides engineering and financial assistance for safety and 

[9:2:58,375] infrastructure improvements. The division maintains the California Aviation System Plan, provides guidance for land use 

[9:3:58,384] compatibility in areas around airports, administers airport noise standards and regulations, and enhances goods movement 

[9:4:58,393] to and from airports through improved ground access. 

[9:5:58,411] 1835010 - CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT 

[10:0:58,429] The Capital Outlay Support program is responsible for developing capital projects on the state highway system and 

[10:1:58,438] preparing these for the construction phase. Functions of this program include the activities necessary to deliver construction 

[10:2:58,447] projects, such as engineering and design work, environmental studies, right-of-way acquisition, and construction inspection 

[10:3:58,456] activities. The program also oversees private contractors that undertake the direct construction work for projects. 

[10:4:58,474] 1835019 - CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS 

[11:0:58,492] This program funds capacity projects in the State Transportation Improvement Program and repair projects in the State 

[11:1:58,501] Highway Operations and Protection Program. Projects are programmed by Caltrans and funding is allocated by the 

[11:2:58,510] California Transportation Commission. Project funding is used for acquisition of right-of-way and for construction. 

[12:0:58,528] 1835020 - LOCAL ASSISTANCE 

[13:0:58,546] This program provides state and federal funds to over 600 cities, counties and regional agencies to improve their 

[13:1:58,555] transportation infrastructure or provide transportation services. The program also provides guidance, expertise, and 

[13:2:58,564] oversight of transportation projects to monitor compliance with state and federal requirements to ensure successful project 

[13:3:58,573] completion. 

[14:0:58,591] 1835029 - PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT 

[15:0:58,609] The program assists the department in fully utilizing available state and federal transportation funds for both the state 

[15:1:58,618] highway and intercity rail systems. The Division of Research, Innovation and System Information provides research and 

[15:2:58,627] data solutions needed to make informed decisions that improve California's transportation system. The Division of 

[15:3:58,636] Transportation Programming produces the State Transportation Improvement Program, State Highway Operations and 

[15:4:58,645] Protection Program, and the Federal Statewide Transportation Improvement Program documents.  

[15:5:58,663] 1835038 - LEGAL

[6:0:58,302] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[7:0:58,318] • 

[8:0:68,320] Driver License and Identification Card Federal Compliance - Federal regulations require states to become fully compliant 

[8:1:68,329] with national standards for the issuance of state driver licenses and identification cards by October 1, 2020, after which 

[8:2:68,338] non-compliant cards will not be accepted for federal purposes such as boarding an airplane. The Budget provides 

[8:3:68,347] $23 million to DMV to begin issuing federally compliant driver licenses and identification cards starting in January 2018. 

[8:4:68,365] Motor Voter Program - Chapter 729, Statutes of 2015 (AB 1461), requires DMV to create an automatic voter registration 

[8:5:68,374] process for qualified individuals who apply for a driver license or identification card, or submit a change of address to 

[8:6:68,383] DMV. The Budget provides $7 million to DMV to develop a fully automated and paperless process for applications for an 

[8:7:68,392] original driver license or identification card that meets the requirements of Chapter 729.
