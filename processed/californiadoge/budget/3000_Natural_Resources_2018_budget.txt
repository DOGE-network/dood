[6:0:66,340] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[6:1:66,358] 2300 - EDUCATION 

[7:0:66,376] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the Science Center-Education represents one of California's premier educational and 

[7:1:66,386] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops 

[7:2:66,396] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 

[8:0:66,414] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 

[8:1:66,424] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 

[8:2:66,434] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary 

[8:3:66,444] home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its 

[8:4:66,454] permanent home - is completed. 

[9:0:66,472] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 

[9:1:66,482] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 

[9:2:66,493] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a 

[9:3:66,503] Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The 

[9:4:66,513] school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 

[10:0:66,531] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 

[10:1:66,541] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding 

[10:2:66,551] support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation. 

[10:3:66,569] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT 

[11:0:66,586] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management 

[11:1:66,597] and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events, 

[11:2:66,607] and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is 

[11:3:66,617] responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of 

[11:4:66,627] park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park 

[12:0:66,637] Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in

[1:0:201,43] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy 

[1:1:66,64] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the extraordinary natural and 

[1:2:66,74] recreational resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing 

[1:3:66,84] programs that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed 

[1:4:66,95] restoration, improve stream environments and wildlife habitats, and improve water quality. The Conservancy also balances 

[1:5:66,105] these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by 

[1:6:66,115] acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 

[2:0:66,133] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is a 1997 

[2:1:66,143] agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and 

[2:2:66,153] various private entities to commit $908 million over 10 years to a list of acquisition and capital improvement projects needed to 

[2:3:66,163] achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 

[2:4:66,174] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was finalized in July 2009. 

[2:5:66,191] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program 

[2:6:66,201] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[7:0:66,426] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[7:1:66,445] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 

[8:0:66,465] The California Tahoe Conservancy performs day-to-day management and maintenance of the lands it has acquired, as well as 

[8:1:66,475] the completion of corrective and restorative actions needed to fully achieve the purposes of the acquisitions. It is envisioned 

[8:2:66,485] that the Conservancy will acquire up to 6,000 environmentally sensitive parcels under existing criteria. To date, nearly 4,900 

[8:3:66,496] parcels, totaling nearly 6,500 acres, have been acquired. These parcels are being managed to maintain and/or restore their 

[8:4:66,506] natural functions, provide for public safety, and provide for open spaces. 

[9:0:66,526] The Conservancy has also acquired additional parcels where more extensive site improvements or more active ultimate uses 

[9:1:66,536] are envisioned. For example, the management objectives for the public access and recreation lands are to allow for: suitable 

[9:2:66,547] and appropriate interim uses during the site improvement planning and implementation process, design and construction of 

[9:3:66,557] public access facilities, and long-term management. 

[10:0:66,577] In addition, high rates of tree mortality (25 - 40 percent) throughout the Basin have required special emphasis on forest 

[10:1:66,587] resource management activities to reduce fuel hazards, remove hazardous conditions, start corrective actions to manage forest 

[10:2:66,598] health through a variety of means, and limit public liability. Activities include the removal of diseased, dead and dying trees to 

[10:3:66,608] promote forest health while reducing the risk of fire that would destroy property and habitat, threaten lives, and diminish the 

[10:4:66,618] water quality and other resource values of Lake Tahoe. 

[11:0:66,638] The program also provides grants to local governments to improve the Lake's water quality by controlling soil erosion caused 

[11:1:66,649] by existing development, primarily along roadways, and to treat sediment-laden runoff. These projects involve acquisitions and 

[11:2:66,659] site improvements such as the revegetation of barren slopes, and building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment 

[11:3:66,669] basins. 

[12:0:66,687] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 

[13:0:66,704] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 

[13:1:66,715] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[6:0:66,275] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[7:0:66,293] The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat, 

[7:1:66,303] watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer 

[7:2:66,313] of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake Tahoe Basin - a 

[7:3:66,323] 1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local 

[7:4:66,334] governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 

[7:5:66,344] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

[1:0:200,43] 3340   California Conservation Corps 

[2:0:66,64] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires, 

[2:1:66,74] floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at 

[2:2:66,84] public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become 

[2:3:66,95] strong workers and citizens. 

[3:0:66,112] In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that 

[3:1:66,123] are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities. 

[3:2:66,140] Because CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 

[3:3:66,150] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[4:0:66,114] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:0:66,132] 2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 

[6:0:66,150] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 

[6:1:66,160] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and 

[6:2:66,170] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal, 

[6:3:66,180] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about 

[6:4:66,191] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development. 

[6:5:66,208] 2425 - OIL, GAS, AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES 

[7:0:66,226] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to protect the 

[7:1:66,236] environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety. The state is fully reimbursed for program expenditures by annual 

[7:2:66,246] assessments and fees on the respective industries. Approximately 450 companies operate over 88,000 wells in California for 

[7:3:66,257] the production of oil, natural gas, and geothermal resources. 

[7:4:66,274] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 

[8:0:66,292] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. Under the Land Conservation 

[8:1:66,302] Act, landowners who agree to keep their property undeveloped for at least ten years receive lower property tax assessments. 

[8:2:66,312] The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts for the 

[8:3:66,323] acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development rights, and therefore development 

[8:4:66,333] pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program within the Land Resource Protection 

[8:5:66,343] Program develops maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to 

[8:6:66,353] assist in local land use decisions. 

[8:7:66,371] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 

[9:0:66,389] This program regulates active surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the 

[9:1:66,399] Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to 

[9:2:66,409] reclaim mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned 

[9:3:66,419] mines and remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety. 

[9:4:66,437] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD 

[10:0:66,455] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of 

[10:1:66,465] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The Department's California Geological Survey and the Office of Mine 

[10:2:66,475] Reclamation provide the engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for the reports, plans, and maps which the 

[10:3:66,485] Board approves. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notices of violations 

[10:4:66,495] or orders to comply, and disputes with local lead agencies.

[1:0:164,43] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the 

[2:1:66,74] property and resources of California. 

[3:0:66,92] CAL FIRE provides all hazard emergency - fire, medical, rescue and disaster - response to the public and provides leadership 

[3:1:66,102] in the protection of life, property and natural resources. 

[4:0:66,120] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety 

[5:0:66,130] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information & education; resource protection; and emergency response. 

[5:1:66,148] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 

[5:2:66,158] diverse yet complementary efforts including: training California's fire service professionals; public education and prevention 

[5:3:66,168] awareness; responsible stewardship of our natural resources; and natural resource and emergency management. 

[6:0:66,186] CAL FIRE's highly trained professionals and leaders cultivate mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels 

[6:1:66,196] of government and the private sector to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate 

[6:2:66,206] emergencies in the urban, rural, and wild land areas of California. 

[7:0:66,224] CAL FIRE promotes a culture of innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, planning, workplace safety, and teamwork to 

[7:1:66,234] foster an efficient and effective organizational environment. 

[8:0:66,252] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 

[8:1:66,262] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:129,38] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] 2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 

[4:0:66,83] CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property and natural resources within social, political and economic 

[4:1:66,93] constraints. The objective is to quickly and aggressively attack all fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct 

[4:2:66,103] protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and 

[4:3:66,113] follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires within the first 

[4:4:66,123] burning period. 

[5:0:66,141] 2465010 - Fire Prevention: 

[6:0:66,159] This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression 

[6:1:66,169] cost recovery and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials and procedures to 

[6:2:66,179] mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be 

[6:3:66,189] done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of fire fighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters 

[6:4:66,200] and damage to the environment. 

[7:0:66,217] 2465019 - Fire Control: 

[8:0:66,235] The objective of this program is to detect, respond and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility Area. 

[8:1:66,245] The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 10 

[8:2:66,255] acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, 

[8:3:66,266] bulldozers, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. 

[9:0:66,283] 2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 

[10:0:66,301] CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state and federal agencies throughout California

[10:2:66,321] agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department. 

[11:0:66,339] 2465037 - Conservation Camps: 

[12:0:66,357] CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Operations and Juvenile 

[12:1:66,367] Justice, operates 39 conservation camps throughout the state that house 196 fire crews. These crews provide one of the 

[12:2:66,377] primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency response, and conservation related work projects. 

[13:0:66,395] 2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 

[14:0:66,413] CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 

[14:1:66,423] with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was 

[14:2:66,433] incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management 

[14:3:66,443] Agency (FEMA) or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of 

[14:4:66,453] this cost through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 

[15:0:66,471] 2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 

[16:0:66,489] California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands and urban forests provide multiple human, climate and 

[16:1:66,499] environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to 

[16:2:66,509] these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting, 

[16:3:66,519] coordination of climate related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial landowners, operation of 

[16:4:66,530] state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects and administration of federal 

[16:5:66,540] forestry assistance programs. 

[17:0:66,557] 2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement:

[18:1:66,585] control of forest pests; growing and selling tree seedlings for reforestation, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion control; 

[18:2:66,596] maintenance of a native conifer seed bank; advice and assistance to non-industrial forest landowners on management of 

[18:3:66,606] forests and improved harvesting and conservation practices; research on and demonstration of sustainable forestry in state 

[18:4:66,616] forests; implementation of the California Forest Improvement Act of 1978; technical assistance and grants to foster the 

[18:5:66,626] environmental, social, and economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; and 

[18:6:66,636] purchase and monitoring of working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008. In the area of 

[18:7:66,647] vegetation management, assistance is provided to public and private landowners to achieve land use objectives by reducing 

[18:8:66,657] damage from wildland fires, increase wildlife habitat, increase productivity of forest and rangelands, improve water yields and 

[18:9:66,667] air quality, reduce carbon emissions from wildland fires, increase firefighter safety, and maintain desirable ecosystems. CAL 

[18:10:66,677] FIRE cooperates with federal, state and local agencies, local organizations, and private property owners to develop and 

[18:11:66,687] achieve land use objectives. Activities include removal, rearrangement, conversion, or improvement of vegetation using various 

[18:12:66,698] treatment measures such as prescribed fire and mechanical, manual, and biological methods. The Environmental Protection

[1:0:215,43] 3560   State Lands Commission 

[2:0:66,64] The California State Lands Commission serves the people of California by providing stewardship of the lands, waterways, and 

[2:1:66,74] resources entrusted to its care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the 

[2:2:66,84] promotion of public access. Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in 

[2:3:66,95] the generation of over $11 billion in revenues while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those lands and 

[2:4:66,105] resources. 

[3:0:66,125] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands 

[3:1:66,135] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and resources, 

[3:2:66,146] which the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently conveyed to the 

[3:3:66,156] state by the federal government (commonly known as "school" lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands 

[4:0:66,166] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of the state's tidelands 

[4:1:66,176] consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced from the granted lands 

[4:2:66,186] back into the trust. 

[5:0:66,207] Public trust or "sovereign" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and 

[5:1:66,217] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean high tide 

[5:2:66,227] line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to sovereign lands, the 

[5:3:66,237] Commission manages "school" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government under the Act of March 3, 

[5:4:66,248] 1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands include the 16th and 36th 

[6:0:66,258] sections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or previously taken by private claims) 

[6:1:66,268] and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, 

[6:2:66,278] only about 460,370 acres remain in state ownership and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The 

[6:3:66,288] Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

[11:2:66,615] safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 

[11:3:66,626] geothermal resources and other minerals; collect revenues generated consistent with the best interests of the state, and ensure 

[11:4:66,636] that public safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these 

[11:5:66,646] resources through engineering review, marine facility inspections, and safety audits. The Commission also adopts regulations 

[11:6:66,656] for the prevention of oil spills, the safe operation of offshore facilities and program and financial audits to ensure the state 

[11:7:66,666] receives fair value for the development of its resources. 

[11:8:66,684] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT 

[12:0:66,702] The State Lands Commission manages all ungranted state sovereign lands consistent with the common law public trust 

[12:1:66,712] doctrine and prudent land use and management practices. The Commission issues leases and permits for the use and

[3:2:66,85] Retirement System. The Commission also oversees the administration of public trust lands legislatively granted to local 

[3:3:66,95] jurisdictions to manage on behalf of the State, including the major ports in the State. 

[3:4:66,113] 2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROGRAM 

[4:0:66,131] The State Lands Commission adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within California, providing the 

[4:1:66,141] best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Commission's Marine Environmental 

[4:2:66,151] Protection Program monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities and reviews, and approves all 

[4:3:66,161] marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification programs . The Program also administers Chapter 31F of 

[4:4:66,172] the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for purpose. In addition, the Marine Environmental 

[4:5:66,182] Protection Program implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous 

[4:6:66,192] species into California waters through vessel mediated vectors. The program funds and conducts scientific research, develops 

[4:7:66,202] rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing vessels to assess 

[4:8:66,212] compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions.

[1:0:197,43] 3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife 

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the 

[2:1:66,74] habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. 

[3:0:66,92] This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to ensure the survival of all species and 

[3:1:66,102] natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational, 

[3:2:66,112] commercial, scientific, and educational uses. 

[4:0:66,130] Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 

[4:1:66,140] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 

[4:2:66,150] Overview."

[7:1:66,363] 679,000 acres of state-owned land and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the Department. Several state 

[7:2:66,373] agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management responsibilities for these properties 

[7:3:66,383] are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department control continues to increase. The 

[7:4:66,394] properties managed by the Department include: 111 wildlife areas, 136 ecological reserves, 138 public access areas, and 20

[1:0:198,43] 3720   California Coastal Commission 

[2:0:66,64] The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed equally by the Governor, the Senate Rules 

[2:1:66,74] Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 

[2:2:66,84] California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 

[2:3:66,95] recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources, 

[2:4:66,105] and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. New development in the coastal zone requires 

[2:5:66,115] a coastal permit either from local government or the Commission. Local governments are required to prepare a local coastal 

[2:6:66,125] program (LCP) for the coastal zone portion of their jurisdiction. After an LCP has been reviewed and approved by the 

[2:7:66,135] Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act, the Commission's regulatory authority over most types of new 

[2:8:66,146] development is delegated to the local government, subject to limited appeals to the Commission. The Commission also is 

[2:9:66,156] designated the principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone 

[2:10:66,166] Management Act in California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal 

[2:11:66,176] development projects, and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be 

[2:12:66,186] subject to state control.

[1:0:183,43] 3790   Department of Parks and Recreation 

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 

[3:0:66,74] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 

[3:1:66,84] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 

[3:2:66,95] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the 

[3:3:66,105] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 

[3:4:66,115] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 

[3:5:66,125] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 

[3:6:66,135] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 

[3:7:66,146] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 

[3:8:66,156] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing 

[3:9:66,166] financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies. 

[4:0:66,184] Because Parks' program drives a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 

[4:1:66,194] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:66,162] Public Resources Code, Division 1, Chapter 1 et seq. and Public Resources Code, Division 5, Chapter 1 et seq. 

[7:0:66,199] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[8:0:65,217] •   Fixing State Parks and Improving Access for All Californians—$42 million State Parks and Recreation Fund and 364 

[8:1:76,227] positions to increase services that emphasize those that directly benefit park visitors by improving access, and fixing and 

[8:2:76,237] maintaining the aging infrastructure of the state parks system. The largest area of investment is facilities and maintenance, 

[8:3:76,247] which will contribute to maintaining clean water supplies, clean restrooms, dynamic trail systems, stable historic structures, 

[8:4:76,258] and safe roads. These additional resources will also help address more than $1 billion in deferred maintenance projects 

[8:5:76,268] throughout the state parks system. The natural and cultural management funding will allow the Department to better 

[8:6:76,278] understand, protect, and preserve California's biologically and culturally diverse places under its care. The interpretation and 

[8:7:76,288] education augmentations will build upon the Department's recent focus on developing stronger relationships with the public. 

[8:8:76,298] The public safety positions will focus on providing a safe visitor experience in complex park environments and protecting 

[8:9:76,309] cultural and natural resources. 

[9:0:65,325] •   Solving the Structural Imbalance and Establishing a Reserve—$26.6 million in permanent funding from the State Parks and 

[9:1:76,335] Recreation Fund to address the structural imbalance. Since 2012, the Department has relied on one-time appropriations to 

[9:2:76,345] maintain services across the park system. The Budget ends that pattern and provides sustainable ongoing funding, including 

[9:3:76,355] $8.5 million to establish a prudent reserve balance in the Fund. 

[10:0:65,372] •   Fix Our Parks Investments—$3 million State Parks and Recreation Fund   for the following,   $1 million to make permanent the 

[10:1:76,382] newly established recruitment and training program for hard-to-fill classifications; $1 million for increased law enforcement, 

[10:2:76,392] environmental monitoring, and maintenance grants supporting federal off-highway vehicle recreation; and $1 million for the 

[10:3:76,402] Abandoned Watercraft Abatement grant program to remove abandoned watercraft from California's waterways. 

[11:0:65,418] •   State Parks System Enhancements—$4 million to begin project identification and planning activities necessary to 

[11:1:76,429] strategically allocate Proposition 68 funds dedicated to the state park system. Of this amount, $1.9 million will support 

[11:2:76,439] implementation of the Redwoods Rising project to enhance old growth coastal redwoods, in collaboration with the National 

[11:3:76,449] Park Service and the Save the Redwoods League. 

[12:0:65,465] •   Safe Neighborhood Parks—$277 million to provide grants for the creation of new parks and recreation facilities, as well as 

[12:1:76,475] the rehabilitation of existing local parks, in critically underserved communities throughout California, consistent with the 

[12:2:76,486] Statewide Park Development and Community Revitalization Program. 

[13:0:65,502] •   Per Capita Grants—$186 million to provide for the acquisition and development of neighborhood, community, and regional 

[13:1:76,512] parks and recreation lands and facilities in urban and rural areas. 

[14:0:65,528] •   California Indian Heritage Center—$100 million General Fund for the Department to construct a new museum to protect and 

[14:1:76,538] preserve the history of California’s native peoples. The total cost of the project is estimated at $200 million. The 

[14:2:76,549] Administration will work with stakeholders to raise the additional $100 million necessary to complete the project. This new 

[14:3:76,559] museum would replace the current State Indian Museum, which was built in 1940 on the grounds of Sutter’s Fort State 

[14:4:76,569] Historic Park. The Department would operate the museum and work with tribal representatives in developing appropriate 

[14:5:76,579] content for the interpretive program to engage visitors in celebrating the living cultures of California Tribes. 

[15:0:65,595] •   Fort Ross State Historic Park: Cultural Trail—$852,000 Proposition 12 bond funds   to design a new trail focusing on 

[15:1:76,606] increasing the interpretive program at Fort Ross State Historic Park. The trail would complete a segment of the California 

[15:2:76,616] Coastal Trail and a multimedia interpretive program encouraging park visitors to explore the complex history of the site. The 

[15:3:76,626] interpretive program will be developed through a partnership with stakeholders including the native people of the area and 

[15:4:76,636] UC Berkeley. Total project costs are estimated to be $3.4 million. 

[16:0:65,652] •   Museum of Tolerance Renovation Project—$10 million General Fund on a one-time   basis   for the Department of Parks and 

[16:1:76,663] Recreation to provide a grant for the Museum's renovation project. This funding will provide half of the estimated $20 million 

[16:2:76,673] cost of the renovation to fund critical capital improvements. 

[17:0:65,689] •   Legacy Forests at State Parks—$15 million Proposition 68 for the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect forests in 

[17:1:76,699] state parks. This funding will support restoration efforts in state parks throughout the state, including coastal redwoods, 

[17:2:76,709] central Sierra sequoias, coastal pines, and oak woodlands.

[1:0:104,43] 3820   San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission 

[2:0:66,64] The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional 

[2:1:66,74] authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance San Francisco Bay and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive use 

[2:2:66,84] for this and future generations. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan and relies on it, the 

[3:0:66,95] McAteer-Petris Act, and other regulatory authority to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission 

[3:1:66,105] issues permits for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and 

[3:2:66,115] certain managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. 

[3:3:66,125] By state statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay 

[3:4:66,135] and exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The Commission leads the ongoing multi-

[3:5:66,146] agency regional effort to address the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on the Bay and its environs. Funding for 

[3:6:66,156] these efforts to address climate change is derived mainly from federal grants and other agreements, contracts, and 

[3:7:66,166] reimbursements.

[1:0:196,43] 3860   Department of Water Resources 

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department 

[3:0:66,74] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs and explores future potential solutions to meet ever-growing 

[3:1:66,84] needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to 

[4:0:66,95] prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its 

[4:1:66,105] efficient use. 

[5:0:66,123] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 

[5:1:66,133] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,615] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[6:0:66,633] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 

[7:0:66,651] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water 

[7:1:66,661] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to 

[7:2:66,671] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water 

[7:3:66,681] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water 

[7:4:66,692] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan 

[7:5:66,702] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation, 

[7:6:66,712] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,

[2:0:161,38] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected 

[3:1:66,75] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare 

[3:2:66,85] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure 

[3:3:66,95] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development, 

[3:4:66,106] protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water Element for their 

[3:5:66,116] General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local agencies and 

[3:6:66,126] tribal governments improve coordination between water and land use planning. 

[4:0:66,144] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 

[5:0:66,161] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21 

[5:1:66,172] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals, 

[5:2:66,182] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 

[6:0:66,200] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities which provide 

[6:1:66,210] water to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 

[7:0:66,227] The California WaterFix Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe, 

[7:1:66,238] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the California WaterFix, project specific environmental 

[7:2:66,248] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and 

[7:3:66,258] federal regulations and permits. 

[8:0:66,276] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 

[9:0:66,293] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper 

[9:1:66,304] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for the construction. Activities include 

[9:2:66,314] assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use 

[9:3:66,324] of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities, 

[9:4:66,334] coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in 

[9:5:66,344] cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way 

[9:6:66,355] for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and 

[10:0:66,365] reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities 

[10:1:66,375] associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The 

[10:2:66,385] program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety. 

[11:0:66,403] 3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 

[12:0:66,421] The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC), 

[12:1:66,431] designated floodways and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by 

[12:2:66,441] issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that 

[12:3:66,451] protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San 

[12:4:66,461] Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large 

[12:5:66,472] joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies that operate 

[12:6:66,482] and maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for 

[12:7:66,492] stakeholders. 

[13:0:66,510] 3255 - SERVICES 

[14:0:66,527] This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning, 

[14:1:66,538] development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory; 

[14:2:66,548] information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 

[15:0:66,566] 3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING 

[16:0:66,583] For a limited period of time, this program purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. Beginning 

[16:1:66,593] January 1, 2003, the utility companies resumed responsibility for purchasing power from the spot market. The utilities, however, 

[16:2:66,604] continued to receive power from the Department's long-term energy contracts with energy suppliers, under which the 

[16:3:66,614] Department retains legal and financial responsibility. All energy contracts signed by the Department have now expired or were 

[16:4:66,624] terminated. However, litigation continues against some of the counterparties to these contracts. Additionally, the Department 

[16:5:66,634] retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering $4.621 billion in revenue bonds issued to repay the General Fund 

[16:6:66,644] for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and funding of reserve accounts necessary to maintain an 

[16:7:66,655] investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.

[3:0:66,65] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[4:0:66,83] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control 

[4:1:66,93] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage 

[4:2:66,104] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 

[4:3:66,114] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated 

[4:4:66,124] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate 

[4:5:66,134] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the 

[4:6:66,144] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank 

[4:7:66,155] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs, 

[4:8:66,165] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood 

[4:9:66,175] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[1:0:211,43] 3885   Delta Stewardship Council 

[2:0:66,64] Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is 

[2:1:66,74] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and 

[3:0:66,84] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and 

[3:1:66,95] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted 

[3:2:66,105] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta. 

[3:3:66,115] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other 

[3:4:66,125] relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent 

[3:5:66,135] Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to 

[3:6:66,146] inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
