[7:0:66,355] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:1:66,375] 6500 - STANDARDS  

[8:0:66,395] The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also  

[8:1:66,405] provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and  

[8:2:66,415] counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices.  

[9:0:66,436] The Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures and  

[9:1:66,446] program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement agencies. It  

[9:2:66,456] also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a clearinghouse of  

[9:3:66,466] successful program information. Finally, it conducts accreditation and peace officer feasibility studies.  

[9:4:66,484] 6505 - TRAINING  

[10:0:66,504] The Training Program increases the competence of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that meet  

[10:1:66,515] identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses, and assisting law enforcement  

[10:2:66,525] agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission assesses  

[10:3:66,535] training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of topics  

[10:4:66,545] necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training needs of  

[10:5:66,555] law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Program also presents advanced training for  

[10:6:66,566] law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership Institute, and for  

[10:7:66,576] trainers through the Basic Academy Instructor Certificate Program and the Instructor Development Institute. Other specialty  

[10:8:66,586] programs include the Institute of Criminal Investigation.  

[11:0:66,606] Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are  

[11:1:66,617] enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards.  

[11:2:66,634] 6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING  

[12:0:66,655] The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs associated  

[12:1:66,665] with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses associated with  

[12:2:66,675] training presentations to enable line officers to receive in-service training in areas of critical need. To encourage and assist local  

[12:3:66,685] law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in the selection and training of law enforcement officers,  

[12:4:66,696] the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, approximately 346 cities, and numerous specialized districts  

[12:5:66,706] and local agencies which have agreed to meet the Commission's standards.

[12:0:183,500] 8420   State Compensation Insurance Fund  

[13:0:66,522] State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was originally  

[13:1:66,532] enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing body of a  

[13:2:66,542] private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of directors for  

[13:3:66,552] approval.  

[14:0:66,573] State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore  

[14:1:66,583] injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers located  

[14:2:66,593] in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on policies  

[14:3:66,603] written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, and the  

[14:4:66,613] state is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the California civil  

[14:5:66,624] service process and are actually employees of the state.  

[15:0:66,644] State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the state and  

[15:1:66,654] because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not  

[15:2:66,664] financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund.  

[16:0:66,685] Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation coverage  

[16:1:66,695] and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to private  

[16:2:66,705] employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers'  

[16:3:66,715] compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and  

[17:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[11:1:66,528] The California Department of Food and Agriculture serves the citizens of California by promoting and protecting a safe, healthy  

[11:2:66,538] food supply; and enhancing local and global agricultural trade, through efficient management, innovation, and sound science,  

[11:3:66,548] with a commitment to environmental stewardship.  

[12:0:66,569] The goals of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are to:  

[12:1:65,586] • Promote and protect the diverse local and global marketability of the California agricultural brand, which represents superior  

[12:2:76,596] quality, value, and safety.  

[13:0:65,613] • Optimize resources through collaboration, innovation, and process improvements.  

[14:0:65,629] • Connect rural and urban communities by supporting and participating in educational programs that emphasize a mutual  

[14:1:76,639] appreciation of the value of diverse food and agricultural production systems.  

[14:2:65,655] • Improve regulatory efficiency through proactive coordination with stakeholders.  

[14:3:65,671] • Invest in employee development and succession planning efforts.  

[15:0:66,689] Because the California Department of Food and Agriculture's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the  

[15:1:66,699] Department has a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see

[7:0:66,527] 6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES  

[8:0:66,548] The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and diseases to  

[8:1:66,558] California, promote judicious antimicrobial use and stewardship   and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat  

[8:2:66,568] products that are exempt from federal inspection. In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be  

[8:3:66,578] transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses,  

[8:4:66,589] (3) have severe negative impacts on the environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the  

[8:5:66,599] consumer.  

[9:0:66,617] 6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES  

[10:0:66,637] California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The  

[10:1:66,647] objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural  

[10:2:66,657] commodities, promote consumer protection, increase food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported  

[10:3:66,668] grading services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the  

[10:4:66,678] marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products.  

[10:5:66,695] This program also provides licenses to eligible California cannabis cultivators and maintains a statewide cannabis tracking  

[10:6:66,706] system.

[7:0:66,251] In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources, provides  

[7:1:66,261] industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized communications to  

[7:2:66,271] California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide fairgrounds.  

[8:0:66,292] This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs  

[8:1:66,302] authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA.  

[8:2:66,320] 9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

[8:2:66,232] million customers, four gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home park and propane operators.  

[9:0:66,252] The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions  

[9:1:66,262] include both backward-looking investigations and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk  

[9:2:66,272] assessments to identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC also performs operation and maintenance audits, outage  

[9:3:66,282] inspections, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities.   With the Office of Safety Advocates (OSA)  

[9:4:66,293] sunsetting in 2020 per Chapter 806, Statutes of 2016 (SB 62), the PUC plans to restructure and continue the safety culture  

[9:5:66,303] improvements made by the OSA through risk management that identifies, assesses, and mitigates or eliminates the safety  

[9:6:66,313] risks of the entities the PUC regulates.  

[10:0:66,333] The PUC conducts triennial reviews of utility operations to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. The PUC  

[10:1:66,343] provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities—and to a lesser extent, as directed by statute, an increasing number of  

[10:2:66,353] Community Choice Aggregators, Energy Service Providers, and Core Transport Agents—to follow when purchasing electricity  

[10:3:66,363] and natural gas on behalf of their customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and where  

[10:4:66,374] needed in the state.  

[11:0:66,393] Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation. The PUC is charged with  

[11:1:66,404] implementing and overseeing key components of Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015 (SB 350); Chapter 312, Statutes of 2018 (SB  

[11:2:66,414] 100); and other climate change legislation, including promoting ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, Integrated  

[11:3:66,424] Resource Planning, the state's mandated renewable energy programs, programs for disadvantaged communities, electric  

[11:4:66,434] vehicle programs, and other clean energy programs.  

[12:0:66,454] The PUC oversees programs and regulations to promote both natural gas and electricity reliability and resilience.  

[13:0:66,474] The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate  

[13:1:66,484] discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost  

[13:2:66,494] weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria.  

[14:0:66,514] The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for transmission,  

[14:1:66,524] telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects.  

[15:0:66,544] The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including  

[15:1:66,554] monitoring competitive markets for proper operation, enforcing carrier service standards for telecommunication services,  

[15:2:66,564] regulating rural telecommunication rates, protecting consumers against carrier abuses and fraud by applying licensing  

[15:3:66,575] requirements and rules for offering and terminating telecommunication services, and managing efficient deployment of area  

[15:4:66,585] codes and telephone numbers.  

[16:0:66,605] The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to  

[16:1:66,615] their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality,  

[16:2:66,625] promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change requests,  

[16:3:66,635] and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements.  

[17:0:66,655] The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in  

[17:1:66,665] participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in  

[17:2:66,675] proceedings.  

[18:0:66,695] The Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB) responds to questions regarding utility service and bills and assists consumers who have  

[18:1:66,705] unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. CAB also provides data on the consumer protection

[3:0:66,83] issues it handles to stakeholders and decision makers to inform policy making. A Supplier Diversity program promotes and  

[3:1:66,93] monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse.  

[4:0:66,113] 6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS 

[5:0:66,131] The PUC oversees telecommunication-based universal service programs (Universal Lifeline Telephone Service Trust Fund,  

[5:1:66,141] California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, California Advanced Services Fund, and two  

[5:2:66,151] California High Cost Funds), all of which provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these  

[5:3:66,161] "universal service" programs include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) improving access  

[5:4:66,171] to broadband technology to bridge the digital divide; and (3) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make  

[5:5:66,182] informed choices about basic service and universal lifeline telephone services.  

[6:0:66,201] The California LifeLine Program provides discounted basic residential wireless and wireline telephone service to qualified low-

[6:1:66,212] income households. The California Teleconnect Fund Program provides discounted telecommunication services to qualifying  

[6:2:66,222] schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program mainly  

[6:3:66,232] provides equipment and telephone access services to people with hearing and other disabilities. The California Advanced  

[6:4:66,242] Services Fund Program mainly encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved rural and  

[6:5:66,252] urban areas of California. The California High Cost Fund Programs provide subsidies to carriers obligated to provide telephone  

[6:6:66,263] service to customers residing in rural and high-cost areas.  

[7:0:66,282] 6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 

[8:0:66,300] The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in  

[8:1:66,310] California. All railroads, seven major rail transit agencies, six smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private  

[8:2:66,320] crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-

[8:3:66,331] certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and  

[8:4:66,341] appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of  

[8:5:66,351] hazardous materials by rail.  

[9:0:66,371] For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train control,  

[9:1:66,381] and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or  

[9:2:66,391] disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, as well as crossing safety treatments deployed at each  

[9:3:66,401] crossing. Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing  

[9:4:66,412] hazard elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-

[9:5:66,422] separating highway/rail crossings.  

[10:0:66,442] The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation  

[10:1:66,452] companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, transportation network companies, and charter and scheduled bus operators) and  

[10:2:66,462] privately-owned water ferries. The program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety  

[10:3:66,472] standards and insurance requirements, and protects consumers from for-hire passenger carriers operating illegally.  

[11:0:66,492] 6695 - PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE  

[12:0:66,510] The mandate and function of the Public Advocate's Office is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The Public  

[12:1:66,520] Advocate's Office is a statutorily-defined state entity charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility  

[12:2:66,530] customers and subscribers in all significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction.  

[13:0:66,548] Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the Public Advocate's Office with a director appointed by and serving at the  

[13:1:66,558] pleasure of the Governor and charged the Public Advocate's Office with representing ratepayer interests in PUC proceedings.  

[13:2:66,568] Chapter 1005, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement  

[13:3:66,578] Account to be transferred in the annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account. The law  

[13:4:66,589] further required that "funds in the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account shall be utilized exclusively by  

[13:5:66,599] the division in the performance of its duties as determined by the director" of the Public Advocates Office.  

[14:0:66,617] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that the Public Advocate's Office only represent ratepayers in  

[14:1:66,627] PUC proceedings. SB 201 extended the Public Advocate's Office representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the  

[14:2:66,637] Energy Commission, Air Resources Board, California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.

[5:1:66,191] The California Law Revision Commission (Commission) has the responsibility to make a continuing substantive review of  

[5:2:66,201] California statutory and decisional law, to recommend legislation to make needed reforms, and to make recommendations to  

[5:3:66,211] the Governor and Legislature for revision of the law on major topics (as assigned by the Legislature) that require detailed study  

[5:4:66,221] and cannot easily be handled in the ordinary legislative process.  

[6:0:66,242] The Commission consists of seven gubernatorial appointees plus one Senator, one Assembly Member, and the Legislative  

[6:1:66,252] Counsel. The Commission's work is independent, nonpartisan, and objective.  

[7:0:66,270] The Penal Code is a complex statutory structure that requires study and recommendations for revision. Effective  

[7:1:66,280] January   1,   2020, a new committee within the Commission became   responsible for recommending reforms to simplify and  

[7:2:66,290] rationalize criminal law and criminal procedures included in the Penal Code.

[5:0:197,195] 8855   California State Auditor's Office  

[6:0:66,216] The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public funds  

[6:1:66,226] and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of state and  

[6:2:66,236] local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State  

[6:3:66,247] Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity.  

[6:4:66,257] The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by  

[6:5:66,267] the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually  

[7:0:66,277] conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements  

[7:1:66,287] and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a  

[7:2:66,298] condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that  

[7:3:66,308] requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter  

[7:4:66,318] biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which  

[7:5:66,328] includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.  

[8:0:66,349] The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse,  

[8:1:66,359] and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority  

[8:2:66,369] to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter  

[8:3:66,379] 451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local  

[8:4:66,389] government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the  

[9:0:66,400] potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or  

[9:1:66,410] effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities.  

[10:0:66,430] Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform  

[11:0:66,440] independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The  

[11:1:66,451] State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper  

[11:2:66,461] acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law.  

[12:0:66,481] The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an  

[12:1:66,491] application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10  

[12:2:66,502] years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and  

[12:3:66,512] conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

[3:0:66,83] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,102] 6770 - STATE BUDGET  

[5:0:66,123] To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance  

[5:1:66,133] advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's Budget  

[5:2:66,143] contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and proposed  

[5:3:66,153] expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of Finance assists in  

[5:4:66,164] the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state agencies and  

[5:5:66,174] programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources,  

[5:6:66,184] and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Basic and  

[5:7:66,194] applied economic and tax research functions support the revenue estimates required for the development of the state financial  

[5:8:66,204] plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the evaluation of economic trends or other fiscal developments which affect  

[5:9:66,215] the state. Basic and applied demographic research functions provide data to support the workload estimates of state agencies.  

[5:10:66,232] 6775 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA (FI$Cal) PROJECT SUPPORT  

[6:0:66,253] The Department of Finance is one of four partner agencies responsible for the development, implementation, utilization, and  

[6:1:66,263] maintenance of an integrated statewide financial and administrative information technology system, FI$Cal. This program  

[6:2:66,273] includes Department of Finance subject-matter experts assigned to the FI$Cal Project.  

[6:3:66,291] 6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS  

[7:0:66,311] The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs. The Office of  

[7:1:66,321] State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all  

[7:2:66,332] matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical  

[7:3:66,342] examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of redevelopment  

[7:4:66,352] agencies.  

[8:0:66,370] 6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING  

[9:0:66,390] The Department of Finance is responsible for devising and maintaining a modern and uniform system of statewide accounting. 

[9:1:66,400] The Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit sets statewide fiscal and accounting policies and procedures.   The unit provides fiscal  

[9:2:66,410] direction, consulting services, and training to departments to help ensure that the state's assets are protected and accurate,  

[9:3:66,421] and timely financial information is maintained.   The Department of Finance participates in the development of statewide  

[9:4:66,431] financial systems, and maintains the statewide legacy accounting system (California State Accounting and Reporting System)  

[9:5:66,441] for audit and reporting purposes.

[7:0:66,154] management system that encompasses budgeting, accounting, procurement, cash management, and financial management  

[8:0:66,164] and reporting. FI$Cal, through the adoption of best business practices, will: reengineer business processes; improve efficiency;

[8:0:66,417] The Military Department is responsible for the command, leadership and management of the California National Guard, Youth  

[8:1:66,428] and Community Programs, State Military Reserve and the Naval Militia. The California Military Department, under proper  

[8:2:66,438] authority, organizes, resources, and trains forces with unique capabilities to serve the community, state, and nation. The  

[8:3:66,448] purpose of the California National Guard is to provide mission ready forces to the federal government as directed by the  

[8:4:66,458] President, emergency public safety support to civil authorities as directed by the Governor, and support to our member's  

[8:5:66,468] families and to the community. With an authorized strength of 22,325, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are  

[8:6:66,479] organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance.  

[9:0:66,499] The Military Department Youth and Community Program serves California communities and families by delivering national  

[9:1:66,509] level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic  

[9:2:66,519] structured environment. In addition to the funding that flows through the State Treasury, the Military Department also receives  

[9:3:66,530] federal funding directly from the Department of Defense. A special display titled "Other Federal Funds" shows the funding  

[9:4:66,540] received from this source.  

[10:0:66,560] Because the Military Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay  

[10:1:66,570] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:446,13] GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[2:0:196,29] 8940   Military Department - Continued 

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,72] 6911 - NATIONAL GUARD  

[5:0:66,93] The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our  

[5:1:66,103] State Military Reserve. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications,  

[5:2:66,113] law enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and  

[5:3:66,123] unmanned aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant  

[5:4:66,134] General element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal  

[5:5:66,144] resource management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil  

[5:6:66,154] Support element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and  

[5:7:66,164] unity of purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the  

[5:8:66,174] deployment of Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the  

[5:9:66,185] Governor due to domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with  

[5:10:66,195] the coordination necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Military Reserve is a volunteer component of the  

[5:11:66,205] Military Department whose mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for  

[5:12:66,215] mobilization, demobilization, and provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal  

[5:13:66,225] government provides virtually all supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training,  

[5:14:66,236] deployment, and commitment of the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and  

[5:15:66,246] Air Force Regulations and Training Guidance.  

[6:0:66,263] 6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS  

[7:0:66,281] The Military Department manages and maintains partnerships with the following nine programs while serving more than 13,000  

[7:1:66,291] youth annually: California Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, Porterville Military Academy,  

[7:2:66,302] Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, STARBASE Academy Sacramento and  

[7:3:66,312] STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by the California Legislature and then-

[7:4:66,322] Adjutant General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is designed to provide maximum  

[7:5:66,332] growth and leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It provides leadership opportunities  

[7:6:66,342] for cadets by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their cadet military units, and by  

[8:0:66,353] demonstrating proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of their training, cadets provide  

[8:1:66,363] assistance and support to the school and community. The Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, and Porterville  

[8:2:66,373] Military Academy develops leaders of character by providing rigorous programs to promote excellence in academics,  

[9:0:66,383] leadership, citizenship, athletics, and physical fitness/well being. Additionally, the programs instill the 10 Cadet Corps values of  

[9:1:66,393] loyalty, education, ambition, duty, enthusiasm, respect, service, health, integrity, and personal courage. Using a military  

[10:0:66,404] framework, these programs graduate cadets who are capable of meeting the admissions requirements for college and who are  

[10:1:66,414] prepared for their roles as future leaders. The mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and  

[10:2:66,424] reclaim the lives of 16-18 year old high school dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and  

[10:3:66,434] self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens. The goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to  

[10:4:66,444] motivate elementary school students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as  

[10:5:66,455] they continue their education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their  

[10:6:66,465] understanding of the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of  

[10:7:66,475] STEM activities more attractive and accessible. While attending STARBASE students interact with military personnel to explore  

[10:8:66,485] careers and observe STEM applications in the "real world." These nine youth programs are financed with federal, state and  

[10:9:66,495] local funds. The California National Guard is involved in youth programs because political and community leaders at the  

[10:10:66,506] federal, state, and local levels recognize that the National Guard brings structure, discipline, and effective leadership training  

[10:11:66,516] methods to the educational setting.

[1:0:412,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — GG   115 

[2:0:164,29] 8955   Department of Veterans Affairs - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring  

[3:1:66,93] our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. The CalVet promotes and  

[3:2:66,103] delivers innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners.  

[4:0:66,124] More specifically, the CalVet:  

[4:1:65,141] • Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to  

[4:2:76,152] educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits.  

[5:0:65,168] • Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits  

[5:1:76,178] before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals.  

[6:0:65,194] • Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans  

[6:1:76,204] to acquire farms and homes.  

[7:0:65,221] • Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a  

[7:1:76,231] home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes.  

[8:0:66,259] This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public  

[8:1:66,269] purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment  

[8:2:66,279] assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to  

[8:3:66,289] military service.  

[9:0:66,310] Because the   CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[9:1:66,320] support this need.   For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[15:1:66,465] changes were recommended as part of the master plan and included in the Budget:  

[16:0:65,482] • Realigning Levels of Care—Realigns levels of care by adjusting domiciliary populations at Chula Vista and Yountville and  

[16:1:76,493] converting current Intermediate Care Facilities to Residential Care Facilities at Yountville.  

[16:2:65,509] • Mental Health Services for Veterans—Includes permanent resources to improve behavioral health services at the veterans  

[16:3:76,519] homes by standardizing mental health support staffing.  

[17:0:65,535] • Rightsizing Funding and Support for the Homes—Addresses funding shortfalls at the three oldest veterans homes due to  

[17:1:76,545] increased costs for maintenance and service contracts, supplies, workers’ compensation, utilities, dietary supplies, and  

[17:2:76,556] pharmaceuticals.

[5:0:66,198] In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying  

[5:1:66,208] property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the state  

[5:2:66,218] to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption.  

[5:3:66,236] 7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE  

[6:0:66,256] The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural,  

[6:1:66,266] scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to be  

[6:2:66,277] assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties to  

[6:3:66,287] partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program.  

[6:4:66,305] 7510 - SENIOR CITIZENS' PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT LOAN REPAYMENTS  

[7:0:66,325] The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program allows eligible homeowners to defer payment of residential property  

[7:1:66,335] tax. The state pays the deferred taxes to local governments on behalf of the participants, and places a lien on their property to  

[7:2:66,345] assure repayment when the property is sold or transferred. The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Loan Repayments  

[7:3:66,356] Program captures repayments from individuals that participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program  

[7:4:66,366] and transfers to the General Fund the amount in excess of what is required to fund the Postponement Program claims. The  

[7:5:66,376] Program was suspended in 2009 and was reestablished via legislation in 2014 (Chapter 703, Statutes of 2014).  

[7:6:66,394] 7520 - LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESS PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,411] The Local Update of Census Address Program provides population-based incentive grants of between $7,500 and $125,000 to  

[8:1:66,422] cities and counties, to ensure they participate in the review and update of the United States Census Bureau's Master Address  

[8:2:66,432] List for the 2020 Census.

[1:2:66,85] appropriates $1,000 and authorizes the Director of Finance to allocate up to $200 million General Fund if tobacco settlement

[7:2:66,356] and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow imbalances  

[7:3:66,366] during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the General Fund may  

[7:4:66,377] need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. Budgetary loans may be used to loan monies from various state funds to  

[7:5:66,387] the General Fund to help bridge a budget shortfall. These loans are temporary, and do not harm the operations of departmental  

[7:6:66,397] programs.

[6:0:66,241] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:0:66,261] 7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT  

[8:0:66,281] Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities  

[9:0:66,301] Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to as  

[9:1:66,312] "borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in slightly  

[9:2:66,322] modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables the  

[9:3:66,332] General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these funds'  

[9:4:66,342] money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not interfere  

[9:5:66,352] with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a fund is  

[9:6:66,363] designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State Controller's  

[9:7:66,373] Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund cash  

[9:8:66,383] shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire cash  

[9:9:66,393] balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes.  

[10:0:66,414] A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79,  

[10:1:66,424] Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state entity  

[10:2:66,434] that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 million  

[10:3:66,444] and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in this  

[10:4:66,454] Program.  

[11:0:66,475] A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, Government  

[11:1:66,485] Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity for  

[11:2:66,495] the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the maximum amount for the VIP  

[11:3:66,505] from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this Program.  

[12:0:66,536] Borrowing From Financial Markets  

[13:0:66,556] In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this doctrine,  

[13:1:66,567] an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 1 of Article  

[13:2:66,577] XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This doctrine was  

[13:3:66,587] invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and again in 1971 to  

[13:4:66,597] validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions were invoked in  

[13:5:66,607] 1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like registered warrants,  

[13:6:66,618] required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes provisions were re-

[13:7:66,628] enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84.  

[14:0:66,648] In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided the  

[14:1:66,658] flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external funds  

[14:2:66,669] results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which the  

[14:3:66,679] General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code.  

[15:0:66,699] External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation warrants  

[15:1:66,709] (RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in anticipation of

[3:0:66,83] receiving revenues in the near future.  

[4:0:66,103] Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any  

[4:1:66,113] other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow.  

[5:0:66,144] Overall Program  

[6:0:66,164] Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for the  

[6:1:66,175] past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts nor  

[6:2:66,185] disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. To reflect cash flow, budget data is  

[6:3:66,195] converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the Controller and for  

[6:4:66,205] accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and administrative actions.  

[7:0:66,226] The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and  

[7:1:66,236] assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used  

[7:2:66,246] from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year.  

[7:3:66,264] 7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS  

[8:0:66,281] The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are repaid over  

[8:1:66,292] multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are repaid with interest calculated at the Pooled Money  

[8:2:66,302] Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

[5:0:157,210] 9625   Interest Payments to the Federal Government  

[6:0:66,231] Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal  

[6:1:66,242] government. The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds between  

[6:2:66,252] the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely fund  

[6:3:66,262] disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds in the  

[6:4:66,272] state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal government  

[6:5:66,282] from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state account; and (d) the  

[6:6:66,293] federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the state account until the  

[6:7:66,303] funds are paid out for program purposes.  

[7:0:66,323] The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $283 million or more in federal fund  

[7:1:66,333] expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e.,  

[7:2:66,344] check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be  

[7:3:66,354] deposited before the warrants are issued.  

[8:0:66,374] Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest  

[8:1:66,384] liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

[8:0:168,374] 9650   Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants  

[9:0:66,395] This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents.  

[10:0:66,415] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan.  

[10:1:66,426] Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was added  

[10:2:66,436] in 1982.  

[11:0:66,456] The 2019-20 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016,  

[11:1:66,466] maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested  

[11:2:66,477] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment  

[11:3:66,487] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90  

[11:4:66,497] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer  

[11:5:66,507] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.  

[12:0:66,528] The 2019-20 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and after January 1, 2017,  

[12:1:66,538] maintains the average 80/80 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871.3 for fully vested  

[12:2:66,548] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment  

[12:3:66,558] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 80  

[12:4:66,568] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer  

[12:5:66,579] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.  

[13:0:66,599] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[13:1:66,609] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2019 monthly contribution  

[13:2:66,619] maximums are $734 for a single enrollee, $1,398 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,788 for an enrollee and two or  

[13:3:66,630] more dependents. The 2020 monthly contribution maximums are $767 for a single enrollee, $1,461 for an enrollee and one  

[13:4:66,640] dependent, and $1,868 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan and number of  

[13:5:66,650] dependents.  

[14:0:66,670] Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code  

[14:1:66,681] 6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[7:0:204,253] 9658   Budget Stabilization Account  

[8:0:66,274] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization  

[8:1:66,285] Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. Proposition 2 strengthened  

[8:2:66,295] the reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the  

[8:3:66,305] BSA, and increasing the reserve limit.  

[9:0:66,325] Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers  

[9:1:66,336] between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a calculated  

[9:2:66,346] amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities.

[12:0:66,477] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[13:0:66,497] 7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy day"  

[13:1:66,507] 50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital gains over 8  

[13:2:66,517] percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 percent to pay  

[13:3:66,527] down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy day," reduced by  

[13:4:66,537] any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance in the BSA is limited to  

[13:5:66,548] 10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes for the fiscal year. Any amounts in excess of ten percent may only be used for  

[13:6:66,558] infrastructure needs.  

[14:0:66,578] Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years.  

[15:0:66,599] The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds  

[15:1:66,609] from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for  

[15:2:66,619] appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year.  

[16:0:66,639] Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will  

[16:1:66,650] smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum  

[16:2:66,660] guarantee calculation.   See 9889 - Public School System Stabilization Account for more information on the Proposition 98  

[16:3:66,670] reserve.

[7:0:66,300] This program includes all claims approved by the three-member California Victim Compensation Board and the Government  

[7:1:66,310] Claims Program under the Department of General Services, and referred to the Legislature in the omnibus claims bills for  

[7:2:66,321] payment. The program provides an equitable procedure for the payment of the following categories of claims:  

[7:3:65,338] • Claims for which no appropriation has been made or for which no fund is available, but the settlement of which has been  

[7:4:76,349] provided for by statute or constitutional provision.  

[7:5:65,365] • Claims for which the appropriation made or fund designated is exhausted.  

[7:6:65,381] • Claims for which settlement is not otherwise provided for by statute or constitutional provision.  

[7:7:66,399] The Government Claims Program was transferred to the Department of General Services from the former California Victim  

[7:8:66,409] Compensation and Government Claims Board in July 2016. The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims  

[7:9:66,419] Board became the California Victim Compensation Board.

[13:0:66,637] This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated money,  

[13:1:66,647] through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the funding for  

[13:2:66,657] those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet appropriated by the  

[13:3:66,667] Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item.  

[14:0:66,688] Additionally, this item sets aside funding for penalties the state may face under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Beginning in  

[14:1:66,698] 2015, the state became subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provision of the ACA. This provision requires large  

[15:0:66,708] employers to offer health benefits to full-time employees, defined as those who work on average 130 or more hours per month  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,83] (or 30 hours per week), and their dependent children. Under this provision, the state may be subject to penalties (Part B  

[3:1:66,93] Penalty), which may include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that may have been considered full-time for one or  

[3:2:66,103] more months, were not offered or did not qualify for health benefits through the state, purchased health coverage from the  

[3:3:66,113] Health Insurance Marketplace (known as Covered California), and received a premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction.  

[4:0:66,134] The ACA also contains reporting requirements, which require the state to track specified ACA-related employee information on  

[4:1:66,144] a monthly basis to identify the employees who meet health eligibility requirements, document whether benefits were offered,  

[4:2:66,154] and whether the employee accepted benefits. This data collection is used to report the state's level of ACA compliance to the  

[4:3:66,164] Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. The state may be assessed penalties for inaccurate reporting (Internal Revenue  

[4:4:66,175] Code sections 6721 and 6722).

[14:0:168,605] 9885   Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances  

[14:1:66,627] For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not yet  

[14:2:66,637] been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure totals.  

[14:3:66,647] This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department budgets.  

[15:0:66,667] For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that  

[15:1:66,678] encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore,  

[15:2:66,688] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General  

[15:3:66,698] Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and state  

[15:4:66,708] policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide adjustment

[3:0:66,83] to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government Code Section  

[3:1:66,93] 13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary Schedule 1 for the  

[3:2:66,103] General Fund.  

[3:3:66,124] COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT  

[4:0:66,144] The State Controller's Office accumulated a preliminary estimated General Fund encumbrance total of $3,175,060,000 from  

[4:1:66,154] 2018-19 year-end financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are estimated  

[4:2:66,164] to be at the same level for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within the next fiscal  

[4:3:66,175] year. The Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the encumbrance adjustment.
