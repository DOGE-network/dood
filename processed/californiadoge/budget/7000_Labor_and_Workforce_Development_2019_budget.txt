[14:3:66,435] and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes  

[14:4:66,445] special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout

[16:2:66,514] and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California in local  

[16:3:66,524] communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce,  

[16:4:66,534] veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to  

[16:5:66,544] job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention,  

[16:6:66,554] earnings, and occupational skills of participants.

[11:4:66,625] the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial   courts.  

[12:0:66,646] The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to:  

[12:1:65,663] • Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively

[13:0:65,690] • Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees,

[1:0:378,13] LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 

[2:0:154,32] 7350   Department of Industrial Relations - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize  

[3:1:66,79] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides  

[3:2:66,89] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits.  

[3:3:66,99] The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system  

[3:4:66,109] required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured  

[3:5:66,120] Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and  

[3:6:66,130] sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system  

[3:7:66,140] designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system.  

[3:8:66,150] Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical  

[3:9:66,160] Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-

[3:10:66,171] based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by  

[3:11:66,181] identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system.  

[4:0:66,199] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'  

[5:0:66,209] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court,  

[5:1:66,219] and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.  

[6:0:66,237] 6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[7:0:66,254] The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for: (1) issuing an annual report on the state  

[7:1:66,265] of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications which would  

[7:2:66,275] improve the operation of the system; (2) conducting specified surveys and evaluations required by law; (3) conducting  

[7:3:66,285] continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and  

[7:4:66,295] occupational diseases, including making recommendations on how to improve the workers' compensation and health and  

[7:5:66,305] safety program, and if it deems appropriate, conducting or contracting for studies necessary to carry out its responsibilities; (4)  

[7:6:66,316] maintaining the occupational safety and health training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services  

[7:7:66,326] coordinator; and (5) issuing, if necessary, a report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices  

[7:8:66,336] required to be provided by insurers and self-insured employers.  

[8:0:66,354] 6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  

[9:0:66,371] The objectives of this program include the promotion and enforcement of measures to protect the health and safety of workers  

[9:1:66,382] on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels for the  

[9:2:66,392] benefit of the general public. These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of Occupational  

[9:3:66,402] Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational  

[9:4:66,412] Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board).  

[10:0:66,430] DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and  

[10:1:66,440] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to  

[10:2:66,450] operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels. The  

[10:3:66,460] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these  

[10:4:66,471] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety records,  

[10:5:66,481] reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and provides  

[10:6:66,491] accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by state and  

[10:7:66,501] local government.  

[11:0:66,519] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as  

[11:1:66,529] follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor,

[3:0:66,69] payment of overtime and minimum wage, the licensing of specific industries, and the payment of wages without required  

[3:1:66,79] deductions; (5) under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, vigorous and targeted enforcement in partnership with  

[3:2:66,89] state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the "underground economy" and administration of  

[3:3:66,99] the prevailing wage program, to determine and publish prevailing wage rates for public works projects; (6) enforcement of  

[3:4:66,109] apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works projects; and (7) management of the Electrician Certification  

[3:5:66,120] Program that tests for the minimum standards for competency and training for electricians in California.  

[3:6:66,137] 6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS  

[4:0:66,155] The objectives of this program are to promote, develop, and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs and to  

[4:1:66,165] provide consultation services to program sponsors. The Division's goal is to match the needs of workers with those of  

[4:2:66,175] employers, and to strengthen the apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting  

[4:3:66,186] workers and teaching the skills they and their employers need.  

[5:0:66,203] The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California. This includes initial program approval and subsequent  

[5:1:66,214] oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs  

[5:2:66,224] and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws.  

[5:3:66,241] The California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the  

[5:4:66,252] general policy under which this program operates.  

[5:5:66,269] 6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES  

[6:0:66,290] The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers'  

[6:1:66,300] compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required  

[6:2:66,310] under the Labor Code.  

[7:0:66,331] The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor  

[7:1:66,341] Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be  

[7:2:66,351] disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
