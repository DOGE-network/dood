[7:0:66,334] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[7:1:65,353] • Centralized Revenue Opportunity System Project Implementation- The Budget includes $10.6 million General Fund and  

[7:2:76,364] $13.9 million   special fund to   complete implementation of the of CDTFA’s major information technology system replacement  

[7:3:76,374] project.   In addition, the Budget includes funds   to incorporate the cannabis tax and the lead acid battery fee,   which were not  

[7:4:76,384] part of the original Project's scope of work.   The Budget also reflects a reduction of 19 positions to match the project's  

[7:5:76,394] changing needs. 

[8:0:65,410] • Cannabis Taxes Program 2020-21- The Budget includes $7.8 million special fund to provide 38.5 positions for the collection  

[8:1:76,421] of cultivation and excise cannabis taxes, and for the provision of additional oversight and tax enforcement activities.  

[8:2:65,437] • International Fuel Tax Agreement Workload Augmentation- The Budget includes $1.4 million special fund for new positions,  

[8:3:76,447] and to reclassify existing positons, to ensure the State’s compliance with the International Fuel Tax Agreement.  

[8:4:65,463] • California Health Care, Research and Prevention, Tobacco Tax Program- The Budget includes $2.3 million   special fund for  

[8:5:76,473] the continuation of 23.5 limited term positions. These resources will allow the CDTFA to ensure tax compliance with the  

[8:6:76,484] increase in cigarette excise tax imposed by Proposition 56 in 2017. 

[9:0:65,500] • Local Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Sunset Exemption- The Budget includes $513,000 special fund for 3.2 positions to  

[9:1:76,510] administer a one-year extension of the local government portion of the prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Tax Program. The  

[9:2:76,520] local government surcharge was set to expire on December 31, 2019, but   was legislatively extended   to December 31, 2020.

[7:0:66,303] The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides  

[7:1:66,313] centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and  

[7:2:66,323] construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building;  

[7:3:66,333] printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's  

[7:4:66,344] vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve  

[7:5:66,354] California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions.  

[8:0:66,374] Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support  

[8:1:66,384] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:1:66,458] 6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES  

[7:0:66,478] With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for  

[7:1:66,488] inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in  

[7:2:66,499] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds  

[7:3:66,509] are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public  

[7:4:66,519] building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school  

[7:5:66,529] districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)  

[7:6:66,539] Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.

[9:0:66,623] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid  

[9:1:66,633] redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate  

[9:2:66,643] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring   protection of lives and  

[9:3:66,654] property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified  

[9:4:66,664] parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their  

[9:5:66,674] programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies,  

[9:6:66,684] and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and  

[9:7:66,694] ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners.

[7:2:66,413] (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition  

[7:3:66,424] and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,

[6:0:66,258] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[6:1:65,278] • The Budget includes an estimated $7.0 billion contribution ($4.0 billion General Fund) to the CalPERS state retirement plans,  

[6:2:76,288] as required by statute. The $330 million estimated increase ($186 million General Fund) from the previous fiscal year is due  

[6:3:76,298] to (1) the normal progression of the existing amortization and smoothing policy, (2) the impact of the supplemental pension  

[6:4:76,308] payments made, and (3) increases in payroll.  

[7:0:65,325] • The 2019 Budget Act included a $3 billion General Fund   supplemental pension payment to be paid to CalPERS over fiscal  

[7:1:76,335] years 2018-19 through 2022-23. Of the entire amount, $2.5 billion was transferred in 2019. The 2020 Budget Act redirects  

[7:2:76,345] the $2.5 billion payment to produce the most immediate savings over fiscal years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22, and  

[7:3:76,355] reduces the remaining $500 million General Fund payment over fiscal years 2020-21 through 2022-23 to a single $243  

[7:4:76,365] million payment in 2020-21 using Proposition 2 debt repayment funding. The impact of this change is not reflected in the  

[7:5:76,376] statutorily-required contributions described above.  

[8:0:65,392] • Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $221 million within the  

[8:1:76,402] Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund's portion of a loan from the Surplus Money  

[8:2:76,412] Investment Fund authorized by Chapter 50, Statutes of 2017 (SB 84). This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental  

[8:3:76,422] pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement plans in 2017-18.

[14:1:111,342] Budget Act. Chapter 33, Statutes of 2019 (SB 90) authorized a $3 billion supplemental pension payment to be paid to CalPERS over fiscal  

[14:2:111,351] years 2018-19 through 2022-23, and Chapter 859, Statutes of 2019 (AB 118) authorized a $100 million supplemental pension payment to be  

[14:3:111,359] paid to CalPERS over fiscal years 2019-20 through 2022-23. The following changes were implemented as part of the Budget Act of 2020:  

[14:4:111,368] (1) remove the General Fund payments currently scheduled over fiscal years 2020-21 through 2022-23, (2) pay the currently scheduled $243  

[14:5:111,377] million 2020-21 General Fund payment to the state patrol member plan using Proposition 2 debt repayment funding, and (3) redirect the $2.5  

[14:6:111,386] billion transferred in 2019 to produce the most immediate savings (over fiscal years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22). None of these  

[14:7:111,395] payments, or the impact of the changes as part of the 2020 Budget Act, are reflected in the Employer Contributions-State amounts. 

[15:0:111,407] 3/ The 2020 Budget Act estimates 2020-21 state contributions to CalPERS to be $6,992,699,000. The decrease in this estimate from the 2020- 

[15:1:111,417] 21 Governor's Budget to the 2020 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans' employer contribution rate, as approved by the  

[15:2:111,426] CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2020 meeting. 

[16:0:111,438] 4/ The 2020 Budget Act estimates 2020-21 administrative expenditures to be $446,556,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of  

[16:1:111,449] Administration at its April 2020 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2020-21 Governor's Budget to the 2020 Budget Act is  

[16:2:111,458] primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits.
[17:0:111,470] 5/ The 2020 Budget Act estimates 2020-21 other expenditures to be $810,762,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at  

[17:1:111,480] its April 2020 meeting. The decrease to this estimate from the 2020-21 Governor's Budget to the 2020 Budget Act is primarily due to a  

[17:2:111,489] decrease in investment external management fees and third party administrator fees.

[1:0:411,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — GOP   77 

[2:0:143,29] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,72] 6410 - RETIREMENT  

[5:0:66,93] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for  

[5:1:66,103] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of  

[5:2:66,113] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2019, there were about 1,294,000 active and inactive members, and  

[5:3:66,123] about 712,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.  

[6:0:66,144] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  

[6:1:66,154] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,  

[6:2:66,164] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract  

[6:3:66,174] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit  

[6:4:66,185] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.  

[7:0:66,205] As of June 30, 2019, there were 2,890 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and  

[7:1:66,215] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their  

[7:2:66,225] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency  

[7:3:66,236] retirement systems.  

[8:0:66,256] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.  

[9:0:66,274] 6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY  

[10:0:66,294] CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the  

[10:1:66,304] federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age,  

[10:2:66,314] Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.   As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the  

[10:3:66,325] liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.   The program is responsible for  

[10:4:66,335] administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting  

[10:5:66,345] and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 

[11:0:66,363] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS  

[12:0:66,383] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee  

[12:1:66,393] associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees,  

[12:2:66,404] retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs,  

[12:3:66,414] provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer  

[12:4:66,424] representatives.  

[13:0:66,444] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,  

[13:1:66,455] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all  

[13:2:66,465] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial  

[13:3:66,475] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.  

[14:0:66,493] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS  

[15:0:66,513] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the  

[15:1:66,523] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired  

[15:2:66,533] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'  

[15:3:66,544] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $376.3 billion, as of June 30, 2019.  

[16:0:66,561] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,582] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of  

[17:1:66,592] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy  

[17:2:66,602] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term  

[17:3:66,612] Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

[10:0:206,529] 7910   Office of Administrative Law  

[11:0:66,550] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state  

[11:1:66,560] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these  

[11:2:66,570] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also  

[11:3:66,581] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been  

[11:4:66,591] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through  

[11:5:66,601] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative  

[11:6:66,611] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members  

[11:7:66,621] of the public regarding California rulemaking law.  

[12:0:66,642] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies  

[12:1:66,652] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the  

[12:2:66,662] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.  

[13:0:66,683] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the  

[13:1:66,693] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[7:0:187,357] 7920   State Teachers' Retirement System  

[7:1:66,378] The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution  

[7:2:66,388] plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred  

[7:3:66,398] compensation plans and programs:  

[7:4:65,416] • State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP)  

[8:0:65,432] • CalSTRS Pension2 Program (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans)  

[8:1:65,449] • Teachers' Health Benefits Fund  

[8:2:65,465] • Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund  

[9:0:66,482] CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school  

[9:1:66,493] teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of  

[9:2:66,503] June 30, 2019, there are approximately 965,000 members, retirees, and beneficiaries of the STRP Defined Benefit Program.  

[10:0:66,523] CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement  

[10:1:66,533] Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

[4:2:66,181] Education Code, Title 1, Division 1, Parts 13 and 14.  

[5:0:66,218] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[5:1:65,237] • The Budget includes $3.4 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS.   The roughly   $104 million increase from  

[5:2:76,247] the previous fiscal year is due to payroll growth. The Budget also   suspends the authority of the Teachers’ Retirement Board  

[5:3:76,258] to increase the state’s contribution in fiscal year 2020-21 pursuant to Education Code section 22955.1.   The Budget   instead  

[5:4:76,268] provides a $297 million supplemental pension payment to CalSTRS using Proposition 2 debt repayment funding, as  

[5:5:76,278] described below.  

[6:0:65,294] • The Budget includes $53 million for the continued implementation and integration of the new pension administration system  

[6:1:76,304] that will replace the existing legacy system.  

[7:0:65,321] • Although not reflected in 7920 – State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Budget includes a   $297 million supplemental  

[7:1:76,331] pension payment   to CalSTRS in   2020-21.   Education Code section 22955.2 authorizes   the state to make supplemental

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,72] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS  

[4:0:66,93] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the  

[4:1:66,103] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the  

[4:2:66,113] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement  

[4:3:66,123] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may  

[4:4:66,134] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the  

[4:5:66,144] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's  

[4:6:66,154] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or  

[4:7:66,164] contract provisions.  

[5:0:66,185] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the  

[5:1:66,195] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of  

[5:2:66,205] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
