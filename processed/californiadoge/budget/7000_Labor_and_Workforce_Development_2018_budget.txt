[3:0:344,433] The Labor and Workforce Development Agency 

[3:1:344,442] was established to address issues relating to 

[3:2:344,452] California workers and their employers. The 

[4:0:344,462] Agency is responsible for labor law enforcement, 

[4:1:344,472] workforce development, and benefit payment and 

[4:2:344,482] adjudication. The Agency works to combat the 

[4:3:344,492] underground economy and help legitimate 

[5:0:344,502] businesses and workers in California through a 

[5:1:344,512] combination of enforcement and education 

[5:2:344,522] activities.

[1:0:177,43] 7100   Employment Development Department 

[2:0:66,64] The Employment Development Department enhances California's economic growth and prosperity by collaboratively delivering 

[2:1:66,74] valuable and innovative services to meet the evolving needs of employers, workers, and job seekers. The Department 

[3:0:66,84] connects employers with job seekers, administers the Unemployment Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Paid Family Leave 

[3:1:66,95] programs, and provides employment and training programs under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. 

[3:2:66,105] Additionally, the Department collects various employment payroll taxes including the personal income tax, and collects and 

[3:3:66,115] provides comprehensive economic, occupational, and socio-demographic labor market information concerning California's 

[3:4:66,125] workforce. 

[4:0:66,143] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 

[4:1:66,153] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[10:3:66,692] provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans, 

[10:4:66,703] youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited 

[10:5:66,713] locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable employment.

[2:0:142,38] 7100   Employment Development Department - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] 5915 - CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD 

[4:0:66,83] The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct 

[4:1:66,93] impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax 

[4:2:66,103] liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one 

[4:3:66,113] each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly. 

[5:0:66,131] The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the 

[5:1:66,141] Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit 

[5:2:66,151] programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction. 

[6:0:66,169] 5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM 

[7:0:66,187] The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California 

[7:1:66,197] workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income 

[7:2:66,207] replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own. 

[8:0:66,225] 5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM 

[9:0:66,242] The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing 

[9:1:66,253] monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take 

[9:2:66,263] time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-

[9:3:66,273] law or to bond with a new minor child. 

[10:0:66,291] 5930 - TAX PROGRAM 

[11:0:66,308] The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax 

[11:1:66,319] collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support 

[11:2:66,329] the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs. 

[12:0:66,347] 5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL 

[13:0:66,364] The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including 

[13:1:66,374] small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages 

[13:2:66,385] and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention 

[13:3:66,395] and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes 

[13:4:66,405] special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout 

[13:5:66,415] the state. 

[14:0:66,433] 5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT 

[15:0:66,451] The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment 

[15:1:66,461] Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide 

[15:2:66,471] and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California in local 

[15:3:66,481] communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce, 

[15:4:66,491] veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to 

[15:5:66,502] job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention, 

[15:6:66,512] earnings, and occupational skills of participants. 

[16:0:66,530] 5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS 

[17:0:66,547] The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as National Emergency Grant Program, 

[17:1:66,557] consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due 

[17:2:66,568] to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to 

[17:3:66,578] react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

[3:5:65,137] •   Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees, 

[3:6:76,147] and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws. 

[3:7:65,163] •   Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings.

[8:1:66,566] 6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS 

[9:0:66,583] This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group of 

[9:1:66,594] employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is 

[9:2:66,604] actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-

[9:3:66,614] sector employer posts a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer 

[9:4:66,624] defaults on its obligations. 

[10:0:66,642] 6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION 

[11:0:66,660] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize 

[11:1:66,670] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides 

[11:2:66,680] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits. 

[11:3:66,690] The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system 

[11:4:66,700] required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured 

[11:5:66,711] Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and

[3:1:66,75] designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system. 

[3:2:66,85] Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical 

[3:3:66,95] Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-

[3:4:66,106] based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by 

[3:5:66,116] identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system. 

[4:0:66,134] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers' 

[5:0:66,144] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court, 

[5:1:66,154] and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process. 

[6:0:66,172] 6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION 

[7:0:66,189] The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for: (1) issuing an annual report on the state 

[7:1:66,200] of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications which would 

[7:2:66,210] improve the operation of the system; (2) conducting specified surveys and evaluations required by law; (3) conducting 

[7:3:66,220] continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and 

[7:4:66,230] occupational diseases, including making recommendations on how to improve the workers' compensation and health and 

[7:5:66,240] safety program, and if it deems appropriate, conducting or contracting for studies necessary to carry out its responsibilities; (4) 

[7:6:66,251] maintaining the occupational safety and health training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services 

[7:7:66,261] coordinator; and (5) issuing, if necessary, a report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices 

[7:8:66,271] required to be provided by insurers and self-insured employers. 

[8:0:66,289] 6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 

[9:0:66,306] The objectives of this program include the promotion and enforcement of measures to protect the health and safety of workers 

[9:1:66,317] on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels for the 

[9:2:66,327] benefit of the general public. These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of Occupational 

[9:3:66,337] Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational 

[9:4:66,347] Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board). 

[10:0:66,365] DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and 

[10:1:66,375] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to 

[10:2:66,385] operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels. The 

[10:3:66,395] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these 

[10:4:66,406] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety records, 

[10:5:66,416] reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and provides 

[10:6:66,426] accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by state and 

[10:7:66,436] local government. 

[11:0:66,454] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as 

[11:1:66,464] follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor, 

[11:2:66,474] one member from the field of occupational health, and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in 

[11:3:66,485] the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards 

[11:4:66,495] enforced by DOSH. 

[12:0:66,512] The Cal/OSHA Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations 

[12:1:66,523] and accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by DOSH for violations of occupational safety and health standards. It is 

[12:2:66,533] comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from 

[12:3:66,543] the field of management, and one member from the field of labor. 

[13:0:66,561] 6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT 

[14:0:66,578] The objectives of this program include: (1) interpretation and enforcement of sections of the Labor Code which relate to wages, 

[14:1:66,589] hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees engaged in protected 

[15:0:66,599] activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders (as applicable); (2) determination and collection 

[15:1:66,609] of unpaid wages; 3) the licensing of farm labor contractors, industrial homework firms, and talent agencies; the certification of 

[15:2:66,619] studio teachers; the registration of garment manufacturers, car washing and polishing businesses, and entities and individuals 

[15:3:66,629] using minors in door-to-door sales; and permitting for both the employment of minors in the entertainment industry and the 

[15:4:66,640] individuals representing or providing services to minors in the entertainment industry; (4) field enforcement of laws governing 

[15:5:66,650] public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the 

[15:6:66,660] payment of overtime and minimum wage, the licensing of specific industries, and the payment of wages without required 

[16:0:66,670] deductions; (5) under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, vigorous and targeted enforcement in partnership with 

[16:1:66,680] state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the "underground economy" and administration of 

[16:2:66,691] the prevailing wage program, to determine and publish prevailing wage rates for public works projects; (6) enforcement of 

[16:3:66,701] apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works projects; and (7) management of the Electrician Certification 

[16:4:66,711] Program that tests for the minimum standards for competency and training for electricians in California.

[3:0:66,65] 6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS 

[4:0:66,83] The objectives of this program are to promote, develop, and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs and to 

[4:1:66,93] provide consultation services to program sponsors. The Division's goal is to match the needs of workers with those of 

[4:2:66,103] employers, and to strengthen the apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting 

[4:3:66,113] workers and teaching the skills they and their employers need. 

[5:0:66,131] The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California. This includes initial program approval and subsequent 

[5:1:66,141] oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs 

[5:2:66,151] and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. 

[6:0:66,169] The California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the 

[6:1:66,179] general policy under which this program operates. 

[6:2:66,197] 6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES 

[7:0:66,215] The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers' 

[7:1:66,225] compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required 

[7:2:66,235] under the Labor Code. 

[8:0:66,253] The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor 

[8:1:66,263] Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be 

[8:2:66,273] disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
