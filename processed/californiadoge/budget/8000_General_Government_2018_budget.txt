[5:0:66,278] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:1:66,297] 6500 - STANDARDS 

[6:0:66,317] The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also 

[6:1:66,327] provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and 

[6:2:66,337] counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices. 

[7:0:66,358] The Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures and 

[7:1:66,368] program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement agencies. It 

[7:2:66,378] also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a clearinghouse of 

[7:3:66,388] successful program information. Finally, it conducts accreditation and peace officer feasibility studies. 

[7:4:66,406] 6505 - TRAINING 

[8:0:66,424] The Training Program increases the competence of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that meet 

[8:1:66,434] identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses, and assisting law enforcement 

[8:2:66,444] agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission assesses 

[8:3:66,454] training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of topics 

[8:4:66,465] necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training needs of 

[8:5:66,475] law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Program also presents advanced training for 

[8:6:66,485] law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership Institute, and for 

[8:7:66,495] trainers through the Basic Academy Instructor Certificate Program and the Instructor Development Institute. Other specialty 

[8:8:66,505] programs include the Institute of Criminal Investigation. 

[9:0:66,523] Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are 

[9:1:66,533] enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards. 

[9:2:66,551] 6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING 

[10:0:66,569] The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs associated 

[10:1:66,579] with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses associated with 

[10:2:66,589] training presentations and for necessary overtime to enable line officers to receive in-service training in areas of critical need. 

[10:3:66,599] To encourage and assist local law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in the selection and training 

[10:4:66,609] of law enforcement officers, the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, approximately 346 cities, and 

[10:5:66,620] numerous specialized districts and local agencies which have agreed to meet the Commission's standards. 

[10:6:66,637] 6515 - POST ADMINISTRATION 

[11:0:66,658] The   objective of the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training is to be the leading organization in 

[11:1:66,668] establishing professional standards, assuring top-quality training, and providing effective services to develop and support 

[11:2:66,678] California law enforcement personnel.   California POST utilizes the following eight bureaus to insure uniform standards and 

[11:3:66,688] compliance are applied to over 600 law enforcement agencies and 40 police academies statewide: Basic Training; 

[12:0:66,699] Management Counseling and Special Projects; Strategic Communications and Research; Learning Technology Resources; 

[12:1:66,709] Training Program Services; Training Delivery and Compliance; Computer Services, and Administrative Services.

[3:0:66,102] The Council recognizes that the Arts are essential for the cultural, educational, social and economic development of California. 

[3:1:66,112] The Council seeks to further its mandates and services to the public through the development of partnerships with the public 

[3:2:66,123] and private sectors and by providing support to the state's non-profit arts and cultural community, which are broad-based and 

[3:3:66,133] extended across the state from its largest metropolitan areas to its most rural areas. 

[3:4:66,150] The Council is statutorily required to: 

[4:0:65,168] •   Encourage artistic awareness, participation, and expression among the citizens of California. 

[4:1:65,184] •   Help independent local groups develop their own arts programs. 

[5:0:65,201] •   Promote the employment of artists and those skilled in crafts in both the public and private sectors. 

[5:1:65,217] •   Provide for the exhibition of art works in public buildings throughout California.

[1:0:183,43] 8420   State Compensation Insurance Fund 

[2:0:66,64] State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was originally 

[2:1:66,74] enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing body of a 

[2:2:66,84] private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of directors for 

[2:3:66,95] approval. 

[3:0:66,112] State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore 

[3:1:66,123] injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers located 

[3:2:66,133] in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on policies 

[3:3:66,143] written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, and the 

[3:4:66,153] State is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the California civil 

[3:5:66,163] service process and are actually employees of the State. 

[4:0:66,181] State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the State and 

[4:1:66,191] because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not 

[4:2:66,201] financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund. 

[5:0:66,219] Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation coverage 

[5:1:66,229] and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to private 

[5:2:66,240] employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers' 

[5:3:66,250] compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and 

[5:4:66,260] other subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the State provides a 

[5:5:66,270] deposit out of which State Fund pays compensation benefits to injured State workers and medical benefits to health providers, 

[5:6:66,280] and State Fund is reimbursed by state agencies for benefit amounts paid plus a service fee equal to the cost of these services. 

[5:7:66,298] For informational purposes only, the following table provides summary data on actual and estimated workers' compensation 

[5:8:66,308] claims costs paid by state agencies. All workers' compensation costs are included in the individual budgets of the responsible 

[5:9:66,318] state agencies. Costs also include administrative charges under the Master Services Agreement.

[0:0:66,13] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — GG   22   GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[1:0:184,43] 8570   Department of Food and Agriculture 

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Food and Agriculture serves the citizens of California by promoting and protecting a safe, healthy 

[2:1:66,74] food supply, and enhancing local and global agricultural trade, through efficient management, innovation, and sound science, 

[2:2:66,84] with a commitment to environmental stewardship. 

[3:0:66,105] The goals of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are to: 

[3:1:65,123] •   Promote and protect the diverse local and global marketability of the California agricultural brand which represents superior 

[3:2:76,133] quality, value, and safety. 

[4:0:65,149] •   Optimize resources through collaboration, innovation, and process improvements. 

[5:0:65,165] •   Connect rural and urban communities by supporting and participating in educational programs that emphasize a mutual 

[5:1:76,175] appreciation of the value of diverse food and agricultural production systems. 

[6:0:65,192] •   Improve regulatory efficiency through proactive coordination with stakeholders. 

[6:1:65,208] •   Invest in employee development and succession planning efforts. 

[7:0:66,225] Because the California Department of Food and Agriculture's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the 

[8:0:66,236] Department has a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see

[15:0:66,399] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[16:0:65,417] •   California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection, and Outdoor Access for All Act (SB 5)—The Budget includes 

[16:1:76,428] $31 million California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection, and Outdoor Access For All Fund on a one-time 

[16:2:76,438] basis and 9 positions to allow for initial implementation of the Act. This includes $18.4 million for the State Water Efficiency 

[16:3:76,448] and Enhancement Program, $9.1 million for the Healthy Soils Program, and $3.6 million to provide deferred maintenance 

[16:4:76,458] support to the Network of California Fairs. Funding for the fairs will provide more opportunities to generate self-sustaining 

[16:5:76,468] revenue and safer facilities for the public during events and for the emergency personnel who utilize the fairgrounds during 

[16:6:76,479] catastrophic events such as earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. 

[17:0:65,495] •   Continued Implementation of Cannabis Cultivation Licensing and Enforcement—The Budget includes $28.3 million Cannabis 

[17:1:76,505] Control Fund and $18.2 million in reimbursement authority, on a two-year limited-term basis, and 79 positions to continue 

[17:2:76,515] implementation of cannabis cultivation licensing and enforcement programs for recreational and medicinal cannabis. 

[17:3:76,525] Funding for these activities has been phased in based on the timing of statutory requirements, and these resources will 

[17:4:76,536] primarily support the ramp-up of annual licensing, compliance, and enforcement activities, as well as costs for proprietary 

[17:5:76,546] plant and package tags for use with the track-and-trace system.

[2:0:149,38] 8570   Department of Food and Agriculture - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, (3) have severe negative impact on the environment, or (4) 

[3:1:66,75] adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the consumer. 

[3:2:66,93] 6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES 

[4:0:66,110] California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The 

[4:1:66,121] objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural 

[4:2:66,131] commodities, promote consumer protection, food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported grading 

[4:3:66,141] services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the 

[4:4:66,151] marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products. 

[4:5:66,169] This program also provides licenses to eligible California cannabis cultivators and maintains a statewide cannabis tracking 

[4:6:66,179] system. 

[5:0:66,197] This program also provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the 

[5:1:66,207] environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants such as pesticides in food, animal feed and fertilizers. 

[5:2:66,225] 6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 

[5:3:66,242] This program provides limited fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs. 

[6:0:66,260] The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California 

[6:1:66,270] State Fair (an independent state agency). State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and 

[6:2:66,281] periodic financial reviews and audits. 

[6:3:66,298] 6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 

[7:0:66,316] This program provides the fiscal and policy oversight of the federal grants awarded that promote California agriculture, and for 

[7:1:66,326] all CDFA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program activities which are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 

[7:2:66,336] agriculture. 

[8:0:66,354] In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources, provides 

[8:1:66,364] industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized communications to 

[8:2:66,374] California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide fairgrounds. 

[8:3:66,392] This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs 

[8:4:66,402] authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA. 

[8:5:66,420] 9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES 

[9:0:66,438] Executive and Management Services include the executive leadership of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office sets

[1:0:185,43] 8620   Fair Political Practices Commission 

[2:0:66,64] The Fair Political Practices Commission has primary responsibility for the impartial administration, implementation, and 

[2:1:66,74] enforcement of the Political Reform Act of 1974, as amended by the voters and Legislature. The purpose of the Act is to restore 

[2:2:66,84] confidence in governmental processes. The major objectives of the Commission are to: 

[3:0:65,102] •   Provide education about the Act and its requirements to the public and the regulated community including public officials, 

[3:1:76,112] candidates, and lobbyists, and assist with compliance. 

[4:0:65,129] •   Ensure that election campaign contribution and expenditure data is fully and accurately disclosed so that the voters may be 

[4:1:76,139] fully informed. 

[5:0:65,155] •   Enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations fairly and with due process. 

[5:1:65,171] •   Regulate the activities of lobbyists and disclose their finances. 

[6:0:65,187] •   Provide for the disclosure of assets and income of public officials, which may affect their official actions, to avoid conflicts of 

[6:1:76,198] interest or appearances of impropriety.

[4:0:66,152] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:0:66,171] 6680 - REGULATION OF UTILITIES 

[6:0:66,188] Californians spend more than $50 billion annually for services from industries regulated by the PUC. This includes 6 electricity 

[6:1:66,198] utilities (70 percent of electric load in California), 937 telecommunications carriers, 120 water and sewer utilities, 5 natural gas 

[6:2:66,209] utilities with approximately 10.8 million customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home park and 

[6:3:66,219] propane operators. 

[7:0:66,237] The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions 

[7:1:66,247] include both backward-looking investigation and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk 

[7:2:66,257] assessment to identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC also performs operation and maintenance audits, outage 

[7:3:66,267] inspections, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities. 

[8:0:66,285] The PUC conducts triennial reviews of utility operations to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. The PUC 

[8:1:66,295] provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities and other load-serving entities to follow when purchasing electricity and natural 

[8:2:66,305] gas on behalf of their customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and where needed in the 

[8:3:66,315] state. 

[9:0:66,333] Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation. The PUC is charged with 

[9:1:66,343] implementing and overseeing key components of Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015, (SB 350) and other climate change 

[9:2:66,354] legislation, including promoting ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, Integrated Resource Planning, the state's 

[9:3:66,364] mandated renewable energy programs, programs for disadvantaged communities, electric vehicle programs, and other clean 

[9:4:66,374] energy programs. 

[10:0:66,392] The PUC oversees programs and regulations to promote both natural gas and electricity reliability and resilience. 

[11:0:66,409] The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate 

[11:1:66,420] discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost 

[11:2:66,430] weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria. 

[12:0:66,447] The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for transmission, 

[12:1:66,458] telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects. 

[13:0:66,475] The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including 

[13:1:66,486] monitoring competitive markets for proper operation; enforcing customer service standards for telecommunication services; 

[13:2:66,496] regulating basic and rural telecommunication rates; protecting consumers against telecommunications fraud; promoting 

[13:3:66,506] widespread access to advanced video technology; and developing programs to bridge the "digital divide." 

[14:0:66,524] The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to 

[14:1:66,534] their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality, 

[14:2:66,544] promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change requests, 

[14:3:66,554] and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements. 

[15:0:66,572] The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in 

[15:1:66,582] participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in 

[15:2:66,592] proceedings. The Consumer Affairs Branch responds to questions regarding utility service and bills, and assists consumers 

[15:3:66,603] who have unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. A Supplier Diversity program promotes and 

[15:4:66,613] monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse. 

[16:0:66,630] 6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELEPHONE PROGRAMS 

[17:0:66,648] The PUC oversees approximately $770 million in telecommunication-based universal service programs (California Lifeline 

[17:1:66,658] Fund, California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, California Advanced Service Fund, and 

[17:2:66,669] California High Cost Funds), all of which provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these 

[17:3:66,679] "universal service" programs include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) improving access 

[17:4:66,689] to broadband technology; and (3) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make informed choices about 

[17:5:66,699] basic service and universal lifeline telephone services. The California Teleconnect Fund program provides discounted 

[17:6:66,709] telecommunication services to qualifying schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The California

[4:0:66,93] 6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 

[5:0:66,110] The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in 

[5:1:66,121] California. All railroads, 7 major rail transit agencies, 6 smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private 

[5:2:66,131] crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-

[5:3:66,141] certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and 

[5:4:66,151] appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of 

[5:5:66,161] hazardous materials by rail. 

[6:0:66,179] For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train control, 

[6:1:66,189] and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or 

[6:2:66,200] disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, and crossing safety treatments deployed at each crossing. 

[6:3:66,210] Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing hazard 

[6:4:66,220] elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-separating 

[6:5:66,230] highway/rail crossings. 

[7:0:66,248] The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation 

[7:1:66,258] companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, and charter and scheduled bus operators) and privately-owned water ferries. The 

[7:2:66,268] program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety standards and insurance 

[7:3:66,278] requirements, and protects consumers from moving companies and for-hire passenger carriers operating illegally. 

[8:0:66,296] 6695 - OFFICE OF RATEPAYER ADVOCATES 

[9:0:66,314] The mandate and function of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The 

[9:1:66,324] ORA is a statutorily-defined state entity charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility customers and 

[9:2:66,334] subscribers in all significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction. 

[10:0:66,352] Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the ORA with a director appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the 

[10:1:66,362] Governor and charged the ORA with representing ratepayer interests in Commission proceedings. Chapter 1005, Statutes of 

[10:2:66,372] 1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement Account to be transferred in the 

[10:3:66,383] annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account. The law further required that "funds in the 

[10:4:66,393] Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account shall be utilized exclusively by the division in the performance of its 

[10:5:66,403] duties as determined by the director" [of ORA], and that the budget be submitted to the Commission for approval. 

[11:0:66,421] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that ORA only represent ratepayers in PUC proceedings. SB 

[11:1:66,431] 201 extended ORA's representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the Energy Commission, Air Resources Board, 

[11:2:66,441] California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings. 

[12:0:66,459] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2005 (SB 608), authorized the ORA director to appoint a lead attorney to represent the division and 

[12:1:66,469] that "all attorneys assigned by the Commission to perform services for the division shall report to and be directed by the lead 

[12:2:66,479] attorney appointed by the Director [of ORA]." 

[13:0:66,497] Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013 (SB 96), requires the creation of an independent ORA program budget administered and utilized 

[13:1:66,507] exclusively by ORA, subject to review and approval by the Department of Finance. SB 96 also requires the ORA director to 

[13:2:66,517] employ personnel and resources, including attorneys and other legal support staff, at a level sufficient to ensure that customer 

[13:3:66,527] and subscriber interests are effectively represented in all significant proceedings.

[1:0:77,43] 8780   Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government 

[1:1:228,57] Organization and Economy 

[1:2:66,78] The Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (Commission) is the 

[1:3:66,89] state's only independent and citizen-based oversight mechanism. It conducts four to five comprehensive reviews of executive 

[1:4:66,99] branch programs, departments, and agencies each year and recommends ways to improve performance by increasing 

[1:5:66,109] efficiency and effectiveness with existing resources. The Commission is statutorily responsible for analyzing and making 

[1:6:66,119] recommendations to the Legislature on all Governor reorganization plans. 

[2:0:66,137] The Commission is composed of two members of the Senate, two members of the Assembly, and nine unpaid citizen members 

[2:1:66,147] - five appointed by the Governor and four appointed by the Legislature. 

[3:0:66,165] Because of the Commission's independence, the Legislature charged it with oversight of the California State Auditor, including 

[3:1:66,175] contracting with an independent auditor for annually examining the State Audit Fund.

[1:1:66,64] The Commission on Disability Access was established in 2008 pursuant to Chapter 549, Statutes of 2008, and subsequently 

[1:2:66,74] redefined pursuant to Chapter 383, Statutes of 2012, to study existing disability access requirements and compliance, and to 

[1:3:66,84] promote better compliance with existing laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the California 

[1:4:66,95] Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Commission also acts as an information center on disability access compliance statutes and 

[1:5:66,105] regulations, coordinates with state agencies and local building departments, and prevents or minimizes compliance problems 

[1:6:66,115] by California businesses. Lastly, the Commission develops recommendations that enable persons with disabilities to exercise 

[1:7:66,125] their right to full and equal access to public facilities, and facilitate business compliance with laws and regulations to avoid 

[1:8:66,135] unnecessary litigation. 

[2:0:66,153] Effective July 1, 2017, the Commission was transferred to the Department of General Services.

[1:0:197,43] 8855   California State Auditor's Office 

[2:0:66,64] The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public funds 

[2:1:66,74] and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of state and 

[2:2:66,84] local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State 

[2:3:66,95] Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity. 

[2:4:66,105] The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by 

[2:5:66,115] the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually 

[2:6:66,125] conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements 

[2:7:66,135] and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a 

[2:8:66,146] condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that 

[2:9:66,156] requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter 

[2:10:66,166] biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which 

[2:11:66,176] includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. 

[3:0:66,194] The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse, 

[3:1:66,204] and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority 

[3:2:66,214] to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter 

[3:3:66,225] 451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local 

[3:4:66,235] government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the 

[3:5:66,245] potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or 

[3:6:66,255] effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities. 

[4:0:66,273] Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform 

[4:1:66,283] independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The 

[4:2:66,293] State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper 

[4:3:66,303] acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law. 

[5:0:66,321] The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an 

[5:1:66,331] application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10 

[5:2:66,342] years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and 

[5:3:66,352] conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

[7:1:66,411] 6770 - STATE BUDGET 

[8:0:66,428] To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance 

[8:1:66,438] advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's Budget 

[8:2:66,449] contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and proposed 

[8:3:66,459] expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of Finance assists in 

[8:4:66,469] the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state agencies and 

[8:5:66,479] programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources, 

[8:6:66,489] and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Basic and 

[8:7:66,500] applied economic and tax research functions support the revenue estimates required for the development of the state financial

[1:0:231,43] 8940   Military Department 

[2:0:66,64] The Military Department is responsible for the command, leadership and management of the California National Guard, Youth 

[2:1:66,74] and Community Programs, State Military Reserve and the Naval Militia. The California Military Department, under proper 

[2:2:66,84] authority, organizes, resources, and trains forces with unique capabilities to serve the community, state, and nation. The 

[2:3:66,95] purpose of the California National Guard is to provide mission ready forces to the federal government as directed by the 

[2:4:66,105] President, emergency public safety support to civil authorities as directed by the Governor, and support to our member's 

[2:5:66,115] families and to the community. With an authorized strength of 22,325, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are 

[2:6:66,125] organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance. 

[2:7:66,143] The Military Department Youth and Community Program serves California communities and families by delivering national 

[2:8:66,153] level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic 

[2:9:66,163] structured environment. In addition to the funding that flows through the State Treasury, the Military Department also receives 

[2:10:66,174] federal funding directly from the Department of Defense. A special display titled "Other Federal Funds" shows the funding 

[2:11:66,184] received from this source. 

[3:0:66,201] Because the Military Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay 

[3:1:66,212] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:412,24] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — GG   121 

[2:0:196,38] 8940   Military Department - Continued 

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,91] 6911 - NATIONAL GUARD 

[5:0:66,108] The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our 

[5:1:66,119] State Military Reserve. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications, 

[5:2:66,129] law enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and 

[5:3:66,139] unmanned aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant 

[5:4:66,149] General element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal 

[5:5:66,159] resource management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil 

[5:6:66,170] Support element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and 

[5:7:66,180] unity of purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the 

[5:8:66,190] deployment of Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the 

[5:9:66,200] Governor due to domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with 

[5:10:66,210] the coordination necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Military Reserve is a volunteer component of the 

[5:11:66,221] Military Department whose mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for 

[5:12:66,231] mobilization, demobilization, and provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal 

[5:13:66,241] government provides virtually all supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training, 

[5:14:66,251] deployment, and commitment of the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and 

[5:15:66,261] Air Force Regulations and Training Guidance. 

[6:0:66,279] 6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS 

[7:0:66,297] The Military Department manages the following seven programs while serving more than 12,000 youth annually: California 

[7:1:66,307] Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, 

[7:2:66,317] STARBASE Academy Sacramento and STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by 

[7:3:66,327] the California Legislature and then-Adjutant General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is 

[7:4:66,338] designed to provide maximum growth and leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It 

[7:5:66,348] provides leadership opportunities for cadets by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their 

[7:6:66,358] cadet military units, and by demonstrating proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of 

[7:7:66,368] their training, cadets provide assistance and support to the school and community. The Oakland Military Institute College 

[7:8:66,378] Preparatory Academy develops leaders of character by providing a rigorous seven-year college preparatory program to 

[8:0:66,389] promote excellence in the four pillars of academics, leadership, citizenship, and athletics. Using a military framework, the goal 

[8:1:66,399] of Oakland Military Institute is to graduate cadets who are capable of meeting the admissions requirements for any college in 

[8:2:66,409] the nation and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program 

[8:3:66,419] is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 16-18 year old high school dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life 

[8:4:66,429] skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens. The goal of the Department of Defense 

[8:5:66,440] STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology, 

[8:6:66,450] Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement 

[8:7:66,460] and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for 

[8:8:66,470] future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities more attractive and accessible. While attending STARBASE students 

[8:9:66,480] interact with military personnel to explore careers and observe STEM applications in the "real world." These seven youth 

[9:0:66,491] programs are financed with federal, state and local funds. The California National Guard is involved in youth programs because 

[9:1:66,501] political and community leaders at the federal, state, and local levels recognize that the National Guard brings structure, 

[9:2:66,511] discipline, and effective leadership training methods to the educational setting.

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring 

[2:1:66,74] our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. The CalVet promotes and 

[2:2:66,84] delivers innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners. 

[2:3:66,102] More specifically, the CalVet: 

[3:0:65,120] •   Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to 

[3:1:76,130] educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits. 

[4:0:65,146] •   Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits 

[4:1:76,156] before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals. 

[5:0:65,173] •   Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans 

[5:1:76,183] to acquire farms and homes. 

[6:0:65,199] •   Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a 

[6:1:76,209] home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes. 

[7:0:66,227] This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public 

[7:1:66,237] purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment 

[7:2:66,247] assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to 

[7:3:66,258] military service. 

[8:0:66,275] Because the CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 

[8:1:66,285] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:446,24] GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[2:0:224,38] 9100   Tax Relief - Continued 

[3:0:66,84] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[3:1:66,102] 7500 - HOMEOWNERS' PROPERTY TAX RELIEF 

[4:0:66,123] In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying 

[4:1:66,133] property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the state 

[4:2:66,143] to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption. 

[4:3:66,161] 7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE 

[5:0:66,179] The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural, 

[5:1:66,189] scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, Section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to 

[5:2:66,199] be assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties to 

[5:3:66,209] partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program. 

[5:4:66,227] 7510 - SENIOR CITIZENS' PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT LOAN REPAYMENTS 

[5:5:66,245] The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program allows eligible homeowners to defer payment of residential property 

[5:6:66,255] tax. The state pays the deferred taxes to local governments on behalf of the participants, and places a lien on their property to 

[5:7:66,265] assure repayment when the property is sold or transferred. The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Loan Repayments 

[5:8:66,275] Program captures repayments from individuals that participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program 

[5:9:66,285] and transfers to the General Fund the amount in excess of what is required to fund the Postponement Program claims. The 

[5:10:66,296] Program was suspended in 2009 and was reestablished via legislation in 2014 (Chapter 703, Statutes of 2014). 

[5:11:66,313] 7515 - RECALL ELECTIONS 

[6:0:66,331] Recall Elections provides funding for counties to pay for the costs of state recall elections in 2018, including expenses for 

[6:1:66,341] verifying signatures, printing ballots and voter information guides, and operating polling places in accordance with Section 

[6:2:66,351] 11108 of the Elections Code. 

[6:3:66,369] 7520 - LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESS PROGRAM 

[7:0:66,387] The Local Update of Census Address Program provides population-based incentive grants of between $7,500 and $125,000 to 

[7:1:66,397] cities and counties, to ensure they participate in the review and update of the United States Census Bureau's Master Address 

[7:2:66,407] List for the 2020 Census.

[1:0:171,43] 9620   Cash Management and Budgetary Loans 

[2:0:66,64] The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash flow 

[2:1:66,74] and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow imbalances 

[2:2:66,84] during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the General Fund may 

[2:3:66,95] need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. Budgetary loans may be used to loan monies from various state funds to 

[2:4:66,105] the General Fund to help bridge a budget shortfall. These loans are temporary, and do not harm the operations of departmental 

[2:5:66,115] programs.

[13:0:66,581] Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities 

[14:0:66,599] Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to as 

[14:1:66,609] "borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in slightly 

[14:2:66,619] modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables the 

[14:3:66,629] General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these funds' 

[14:4:66,639] money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not interfere 

[14:5:66,650] with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a fund is 

[14:6:66,660] designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State Controller's 

[14:7:66,670] Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund cash 

[14:8:66,680] shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire cash 

[14:9:66,690] balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes.

[1:0:446,24] GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[2:0:136,38] 9620   Cash Management and Budgetary Loans - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79, 

[3:1:66,75] Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state entity 

[3:2:66,85] that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 million 

[3:3:66,95] and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in this 

[3:4:66,106] Program. 

[4:0:66,123] A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, Government 

[4:1:66,134] Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity for 

[4:2:66,144] the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the maximum amount for the VIP 

[4:3:66,154] from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this Program. 

[5:0:66,172] Borrowing From Financial Markets 

[6:0:66,189] In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this doctrine, 

[6:1:66,200] an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 1 of Article 

[6:2:66,210] XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This doctrine was 

[6:3:66,220] invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and again in 1971 to 

[6:4:66,230] validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions were invoked in 

[6:5:66,240] 1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like registered warrants, 

[6:6:66,251] required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes provisions were re-

[6:7:66,261] enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84. 

[7:0:66,278] In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided the 

[7:1:66,289] flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external funds 

[7:2:66,299] results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which the 

[7:3:66,309] General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. 

[8:0:66,327] External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation warrants 

[8:1:66,337] (RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in anticipation of 

[8:2:66,347] receiving revenues in the near future. 

[9:0:66,365] Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any 

[9:1:66,375] other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow. 

[10:0:66,393] Overall Program 

[11:0:66,410] Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for the 

[11:1:66,421] past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts nor 

[11:2:66,431] disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. To reflect cash flow, budget data is 

[11:3:66,441] converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the Controller and for 

[11:4:66,451] accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and administrative actions. 

[12:0:66,469] The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and 

[12:1:66,479] assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used 

[12:2:66,489] from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year. 

[13:0:66,507] 7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS 

[14:0:66,525] The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are repaid over 

[14:1:66,535] multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are repaid with interest calculated at the Pooled Money 

[14:2:66,545] Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

[1:0:157,43] 9625   Interest Payments to the Federal Government 

[2:0:66,64] Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal 

[2:1:66,74] government. The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds between 

[2:2:66,84] the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely fund 

[2:3:66,95] disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds in the 

[2:4:66,105] state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal government 

[2:5:66,115] from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state account; and (d) the 

[2:6:66,125] federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the state account until the 

[2:7:66,135] funds are paid out for program purposes. 

[3:0:66,153] The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $282 million or more in federal fund 

[3:1:66,163] expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e., 

[3:2:66,174] check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be 

[3:3:66,184] deposited before the warrants are issued. 

[4:0:66,201] Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest 

[4:1:66,212] liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

[1:0:168,43] 9650   Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants 

[2:0:66,64] This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents. 

[3:0:66,82] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan. 

[3:1:66,92] Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was added 

[3:2:66,102] in 1982. 

[4:0:66,120] The 2017-18 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016, 

[4:1:66,130] maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested 

[4:2:66,140] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment 

[4:3:66,150] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90 

[4:4:66,161] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer 

[4:5:66,171] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract. 

[5:0:66,189] The 2017-18 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and after January 1, 2017, 

[5:1:66,199] maintains the average 80/80 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871.3 for fully vested 

[5:2:66,209] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment 

[5:3:66,219] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 80 

[5:4:66,229] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer 

[5:5:66,240] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract. 

[6:0:66,257] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 

[6:1:66,267] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2017 monthly contribution 

[6:2:66,278] maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or 

[6:3:66,288] more dependents. The 2018 monthly contribution maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one 

[6:4:66,298] dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan and number of 

[6:5:66,308] dependents. 

[7:0:66,326] Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code 

[7:1:66,336] 6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

[1:0:204,43] 9658   Budget Stabilization Account 

[2:0:66,64] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization 

[2:1:66,74] Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. Proposition 2 strengthened 

[2:2:66,84] the reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the 

[2:3:66,95] BSA, and increasing the reserve limit. 

[3:0:66,112] Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers 

[3:1:66,123] between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a calculated 

[3:2:66,133] amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities.

[5:0:66,178] PROGRAM AUTHORITY 

[6:0:66,198] Section 20, Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California. 

[6:1:66,208] Control Section 35.50, Budget Act.

[8:0:66,246] Item 9658-012-1022, 2018 Budget Act and Government Code Section 16418.8. 

[9:0:66,283] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[10:0:65,302] •   Supplemental Transfer to the Rainy Day Fund - The Budget provides a $2.6 billion transfer from the General Fund to the 

[10:1:76,312] Budget Deficit Savings Account (BDSA). These funds will support a supplemental transfer to the Budget Stabilization 

[10:2:76,322] Account. This transfer is in addition to the current projected amount ($1.7 billion) required by Section 20 of Article XVI of the 

[10:3:76,332] California Constitution. In total, the $4.3 billion transfer brings the Rainy Day Fund to $13.8 billion in 2018-19, achieving the 

[10:4:76,342] maximum balance allowed by the Constitution for the fiscal year. In the event there is an excess amount in the BDSA after 

[10:5:76,353] the 2019-20 May Revision update, the remaining funds shall be divided equally between the BDSA and the Safety Net 

[10:6:76,363] Reserve Fund. 

[11:0:66,400] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[12:0:66,418] 7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy day" 

[12:1:66,428] 50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital gains over 8 

[12:2:66,438] percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 percent to pay 

[12:3:66,449] down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy day," reduced by 

[12:4:66,459] any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance in the BSA is limited to 

[12:5:66,469] 10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes for the fiscal year. Any amounts in excess of ten percent may only be used for 

[12:6:66,479] infrastructure needs. 

[13:0:66,497] Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years. 

[14:0:66,515] The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds 

[14:1:66,525] from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for 

[14:2:66,535] appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year. 

[15:0:66,553] Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will 

[15:1:66,563] smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum 

[15:2:66,573] guarantee calculation and transfers will not occur until various operational and economic conditions are met.

[0:0:66,13] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — GG   196   GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[1:0:164,43] 9800   Augmentation for Employee Compensation 

[2:0:66,64] This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated money, 

[2:1:66,74] through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the funding for 

[2:2:66,84] those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet appropriated by the 

[2:3:66,95] Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item. 

[3:0:66,112] Additionally, this item sets aside funding for penalties the state may face under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Beginning in 

[3:1:66,123] 2015, the state became subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provision of the ACA. This provision requires large 

[3:2:66,133] employers to offer health benefits to full-time employees, defined as those who work on average 130 or more hours per month 

[3:3:66,143] (or 30 hours per week), and their dependent children. Under this provision, the state may be subject to penalties (Part B 

[3:4:66,153] Penalty), which may include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that may have been considered full-time for one or 

[3:5:66,163] more months, were not offered or did not qualify for health benefits through the state, purchased health coverage from the 

[3:6:66,174] Health Insurance Marketplace (known as Covered California), and received a premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction. 

[3:7:66,191] The ACA also contains reporting requirements, which require the state to track specified ACA-related employee information on 

[3:8:66,201] a monthly basis to identify the employees who meet health eligibility requirements, document whether benefits were offered, 

[3:9:66,212] and whether the employee accepted benefits. This data collection is used to report the state's level of ACA compliance to the 

[3:10:66,222] Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. The state may be assessed penalties for inaccurate reporting (Internal Revenue 

[3:11:66,232] Code sections 6721 and 6722).

[1:0:207,43] 9818   Federal Levy of State Funds 

[1:1:66,64] The federal courts periodically issue judgments or "writs of execution" against the State of California requiring the state to make 

[1:2:66,74] payments to the federal government. The writs and judgments provide the authority to the federal government to withdraw 

[1:3:66,84] funds from the state bank accounts maintained by the State Treasurer's Office at the various state depository banks. 

[1:4:66,105] Each year, the Budget Act authorizes the Department of Finance to identify specific appropriations or funds to charge when the 

[1:5:66,115] federal government withdraws funds from state bank accounts. When no specific appropriation or fund can be identified, the 

[1:6:66,125] withdrawals are charged to the unappropriated General Fund balance. 

[2:0:66,146] No levies were paid during the 2016-17 fiscal year and none have been paid through June 15, 2018.

[1:0:168,43] 9885   Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances 

[2:0:66,64] For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not yet 

[2:1:66,74] been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure totals. 

[2:2:66,84] This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department budgets. 

[2:3:66,102] For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that 

[3:0:66,112] encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore, 

[3:1:66,123] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General 

[3:2:66,133] Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and state 

[3:3:66,143] policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide adjustment 

[3:4:66,153] to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government Code Section 

[3:5:66,163] 13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary Schedule 1 for the 

[3:6:66,174] General Fund. 

[4:0:66,191] COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT 

[5:0:66,209] The State Controller's Office accumulated a preliminary estimated General Fund encumbrance total of $1,164,703,000 from 

[5:1:66,219] 2016-17 year-end financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are estimated 

[5:2:66,229] to be at the same level for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within the next fiscal 

[5:3:66,240] year. The Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the encumbrance adjustment.

[1:0:122,43] 9900   Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata) 

[2:0:66,64] Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide 

[3:0:66,74] budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments. The Pro Rata process apportions 

[3:1:66,84] the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit from the 

[4:0:66,95] services. Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are transferred from 

[4:1:66,105] the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund. 

[5:0:66,123] Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata charges to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets. This 

[5:1:66,133] budget item included Pro Rata costs directly charged to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not 

[6:0:66,143] provided for in departmental budgets. Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata costs charged directly at the fund 

[6:1:66,153] level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
