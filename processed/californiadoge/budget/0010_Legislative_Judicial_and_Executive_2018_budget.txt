[1:0:139,43] 0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System 

[1:1:66,64] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional 

[1:2:66,74] officers, and legislative statutory officers. 

[2:0:66,95] The Legislators' Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment 

[2:1:66,105] earnings. Between 2000-01 and 2011-12, the Legislators' Retirement System was super-funded and neither the state nor 

[2:2:66,115] members were required to contribute. Beginning in 2012-13, contributions resumed for the state and members. 

[3:0:66,135] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of 

[3:1:66,146] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death, 

[3:2:66,156] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. 

[4:0:66,176] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November 

[4:1:66,186] 6, 1990. 

[5:0:66,207] Effective January 1, 2013, the Legislators' Retirement System was closed to all new members by the California Public 

[5:1:66,217] Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340). New constitutional officers, statutory 

[5:2:66,227] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[1:0:208,43] 0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau 

[2:0:66,64] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members 

[2:1:66,74] and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The 

[2:2:66,84] legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of legislative 

[2:3:66,95] committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is 

[2:4:66,105] confidential. 

[3:0:66,125] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative 

[3:1:66,135] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes. 

[4:0:66,156] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative 

[4:1:66,166] information system and the processing of legislative measures. 

[5:0:66,186] Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the 

[5:1:66,197] Legislative Counsel Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws 

[5:2:66,207] recommended by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these 

[5:3:66,217] uniform acts.

[0:0:66,13] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — LJE   16   LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[1:0:242,43] 0250   Judicial Branch 

[2:0:66,64] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of 

[2:1:66,74] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. 

[2:2:66,84] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially 

[2:3:66,95] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 

[3:0:66,115] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 

[4:0:66,125] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was 

[4:1:66,135] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This 

[5:0:66,146] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The 

[5:1:66,156] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty 

[6:0:66,166] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments 

[6:1:66,176] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted 

[6:2:66,186] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act 

[6:3:66,197] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the 

[6:4:66,207] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial 

[7:0:66,217] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are 

[7:1:66,227] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of 

[8:0:66,237] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities 

[8:1:66,248] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 

[9:0:66,268] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, 

[9:1:66,278] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United 

[9:2:66,288] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 

[10:0:66,309] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 

[10:1:66,319] program to support this need. For additional information regarding the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see 

[10:2:66,329] "Infrastructure Overview."

[22:1:82,592] funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[23:0:82,598] 2 Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees.

[23:4:84,612]  Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in section 1 in anticipation of their allocation. 

[24:0:82,617] 5 

[24:1:84,618]  See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’  

[24:2:82,624] state funding in Section 1. 

[24:3:82,629] 6 

[24:4:84,629]  See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and  

[24:5:82,635] Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total  

[24:6:82,640] expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total". 

[24:7:82,645] 7 

[24:8:84,646]  For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences. For the current  

[24:9:82,651] year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[25:0:82,657] 8 Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2016-17 and estimated expenditures for 2017-18 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" (as well as Program 0140019 "Trial Court Operations" for FY 2017-18) included in the 2018-19

[24:0:127,565] 1. Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" as well as Program 0140019 "Trial Court Operations" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF),  

[24:1:127,570] General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers' Compensation Fund (JBWCF). The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is  

[24:2:127,574] made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). 

[25:0:127,582] 2. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions"  

[25:1:127,587] display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State  

[25:2:127,591] Trial Court Funding Total".  

[26:0:127,603] 3. This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the Trial  

[26:1:127,608] Court Information section ($115.3 million in 2016-17 and $121.2 million in 2017-18). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In  

[26:2:127,613] addition, 25 courts in 2016-17 and 24 courts in 2017-18 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.
[27:0:127,624] 4. Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program.  

[27:1:127,629] Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. 

[28:0:127,640] 5. For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF. For  

[28:1:127,645] the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.

[2:0:207,38] 0250   Judicial Branch - Continued 

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[3:1:66,91] 0130 - SUPREME COURT 

[4:0:66,111] The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state 

[4:1:66,121] courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the 

[4:2:66,131] Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations 

[4:3:66,142] for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of 

[4:4:66,152] statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the 

[4:5:66,162] Supreme Court. 

[4:6:66,180] 0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 

[5:0:66,200] Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six 

[5:1:66,210] District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the 

[5:2:66,221] Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 

[5:3:66,238] 0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 

[6:0:66,259] The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 

[6:1:66,269] voting members and 11 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as 

[6:2:66,279] the administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation 

[6:3:66,289] of the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and 

[6:4:66,299] administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges, 

[6:5:66,310] technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 

[6:6:66,327] 0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM 

[7:0:66,345] The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of 

[7:1:66,355] judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real 

[7:2:66,365] estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction. 

[7:3:66,383] 0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING 

[7:4:66,401] 0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS 

[8:0:66,419] This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and 

[8:1:66,429] criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003, 

[8:2:66,439] except court-appointed dependency counsel, salaries and benefits of Superior Court judges, compensation for assigned 

[8:3:66,449] judges, support for language interpreters, grants, and expenses on behalf of the trial courts.

[6:0:66,202] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[7:0:66,220] The Judicial Branch consists of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, trial courts, and the Judicial Council. The Supreme Court 

[7:1:66,230] is located in the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco (101,500 square feet) and the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los 

[7:2:66,241] Angeles (7,600 sf). The courts of appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of 

[7:3:66,251] approximately 508,000 sf. The trial courts are located in 58 counties statewide, in approximately 500 buildings and 2,100 

[7:4:66,261] courtrooms of approximately 14 million sf of usable area and more than 21 million sf of space under Judicial Council 

[7:5:66,271] responsibility and management. The facilities of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and trial courts encompass not only the 

[7:6:66,281] public courtroom spaces but also the chambers and workspaces where judicial officers and courtroom staff prepare for 

[7:7:66,292] proceedings; secure areas, including holding cells; and building support functions. Judicial Council administrative facilities, 

[7:8:66,302] occupying approximately 235,000 sf, are located in San Francisco and Sacramento. The Judicial Council consolidated field 

[7:9:66,312] offices to realize program efficiencies and cost savings, by closing its Burbank office on June 30, 2017, to consolidate 

[7:10:66,322] operations between Sacramento and San Francisco and by closing its Real Estate and Facilities Management field offices to 

[7:11:66,332] relocate staff to the court facilities to which they provide service. 

[8:0:66,369] MAJOR PROJECT CHANGES 

[8:1:65,388] •   Courthouse Construction-The Budget includes $1.3 billion lease revenue bond funds and $32.1 million special funds for the 

[8:2:76,398] continuing phases of ten active projects on the Judicial Council's immediate and critical needs list.

[1:0:180,43] 0280   Commission on Judicial Performance 

[2:0:66,64] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of 

[2:1:66,74] judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California 

[2:2:66,84] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of 

[2:3:66,95] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or 

[3:0:66,105] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees. 

[3:1:66,115] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement. 

[4:0:66,135] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial 

[4:1:66,146] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation 

[4:2:66,156] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal 

[4:3:66,166] from office. 

[5:0:66,186] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the 

[6:0:66,197] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, 

[6:1:66,207] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms. 

[6:2:66,217] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[1:0:150,43] 0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System 

[2:0:66,64] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and 

[2:1:66,74] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement 

[2:2:66,84] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members. 

[3:0:66,105] The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, 

[3:1:66,115] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges 

[3:2:66,125] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing 

[3:3:66,135] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit 

[3:4:66,146] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the 

[3:5:66,156] required benefit payments to retired judges. 

[4:0:66,176] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in 

[4:1:66,186] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System 

[4:2:66,197] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final 

[4:3:66,207] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement 

[4:4:66,217] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of 

[4:5:66,227] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined 

[4:6:66,237] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives 

[4:7:66,248] contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted 

[4:8:66,258] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund. 

[5:0:66,278] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 

[5:1:66,288] 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[1:0:199,43] 0552   Office of the Inspector General 

[2:0:66,64] The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional 

[2:1:66,74] system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's 

[2:2:66,84] (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, and the employee disciplinary process. When requested by the Governor, 

[2:3:66,95] the Senate Committee on Rules, or the Speaker of the Assembly, the Inspector General reviews the policies, practices, and 

[2:4:66,105] procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the 

[2:5:66,115] state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the state's juvenile facilities, and   conducts metric-oriented 

[2:6:66,125] inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at each state prison. OIG receives communications from 

[2:7:66,135] individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of 

[2:8:66,146] wrongdoing by employees of CDCR;   conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper 

[2:9:66,156] management where a legally cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews the mishandling of sexual abuse incidents

[1:0:202,43] 0690   Office of Emergency Services 

[2:0:66,64] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (OES) is to protect lives and property, build capabilities, and 

[3:0:66,74] support our communities for a resilient California. The OES Director serves as both the Governor's Homeland Security Advisor 

[3:1:66,84] and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's homeland security and counter-

[3:2:66,95] terrorism strategy. The OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting against, responding to, 

[3:3:66,105] recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats. 

[4:0:66,123] On a day-to-day basis, the OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and 

[5:0:66,133] coordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector 

[5:1:66,143] resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on 

[5:2:66,153] its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those 

[5:3:66,163] of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California. 

[6:0:66,181] During an emergency, the OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 

[6:1:66,191] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 

[6:2:66,201] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, the OES is responsible for the 

[7:0:66,212] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 

[7:1:66,222] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 

[8:0:66,240] The OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which 

[8:1:66,250] includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and one major 

[8:2:66,260] urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and terrorist activity; 

[8:3:66,270] and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. The STAC 

[9:0:66,280] operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-terrorism, situational awareness 

[9:1:66,291] reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety community. Further, the OES improves the 

[9:2:66,301] criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical assistance to local governments, state agencies, and 

[9:3:66,311] the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim services. 

[10:0:66,329] Because the OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the OES has a capital outlay program to support this 

[10:1:66,339] need. For the specifics on the OES' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,91] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 

[5:0:66,108] Through the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program, the OES provides effective use of federal, 

[5:1:66,119] state, and local resources, through the mutual aid system to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended in a 

[5:2:66,129] disaster situation. Also, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-hazards 

[5:3:66,139] approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National Strategy on 

[5:4:66,149] Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this program, 

[5:5:66,159] the OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to all 

[5:6:66,170] hazards. 

[6:0:66,187] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 

[7:0:66,205] The OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services 

[7:1:66,215] grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland 

[7:2:66,225] Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, the OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency 

[7:3:66,236] management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant 

[7:4:66,246] management role, the OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 

[7:5:66,256] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center which is the 

[7:6:66,266] centerpiece of the State's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion 

[7:7:66,276] center. 

[8:0:66,294] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 

[9:0:66,312] Public Safety Communications (PSC) serves the State of California by providing public safety communications to the State's 

[9:1:66,322] first responders and oversight of the 9-1-1 system to the people of California. The PSC is dedicated to the preservation and 

[9:2:66,332] protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services keeping the public 

[9:3:66,342] connected during times of crisis. 

[9:4:66,360] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 

[10:0:66,378] The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of the OES and support services such as

[2:3:66,125] to the Legislature. 

[3:0:66,146] The law also provides for the outgoing Governor to appoint persons for up to a two-month period, to assist in concluding 

[3:1:66,156] matters arising from official duties during the last term of office.

[4:0:66,100] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:0:66,119] 0435 - LEGAL SERVICES 

[6:0:66,136] Legal Services is organized into three elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law, and (3) Public Rights. 

[7:0:66,154] Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in 

[7:1:66,164] civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them and prosecutes cases to vindicate state 

[7:2:66,174] interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative 

[7:3:66,185] tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and 

[7:4:66,195] California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of eight sections: Business and Tax; Correctional Law; Employment and 

[7:5:66,205] Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement; Licensing; or Tort and 

[7:6:66,215] Condemnation. 

[8:0:66,233] Criminal Law represents the state in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts. Criminal Law also fulfills the 

[8:1:66,243] Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are recused, conducts criminal 

[8:2:66,253] investigations, represents the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 

[8:3:66,264] in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole decisions and conditions of 

[8:4:66,274] confinement in the state prisons and defends state and federal habeas corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include 

[8:5:66,284] enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition matters, investigating and prosecuting Medi-Cal 

[8:6:66,294] provider fraud, investigating and prosecuting the abuse or neglect of elder and dependent adults residing in long-term health 

[8:7:66,304] care facilities, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving white-collar crime, high-tech/computer/privacy 

[8:8:66,315] crime, financial crimes against the elderly, human trafficking, environmental crimes, and public corruption. 

[9:0:66,332] Public Rights protects and preserves the public interest by providing legal services to state agencies and Constitutional Officers 

[9:1:66,342] and by bringing actions in the name of the Attorney General to protect the public. Public Rights provides specialized services in 

[9:2:66,353] the following areas: Civil Rights Enforcement (including Underground Economy and the Bureau of Children's Justice); 

[9:3:66,363] Charitable Trusts (including the Registry of Charitable Trusts); Natural Resources Law; Corporate Fraud (including False 

[9:4:66,373] Claims, Energy and Corporate Responsibility); Indian and Gaming Law; Environment Law; Land Law; Consumer Law 

[9:5:66,383] (including Sellers of Travel and Privacy Enforcement and Protection); Antitrust Law; and Tobacco Litigation Enforcement. 

[10:0:66,401] 0440 - LAW ENFORCEMENT 

[11:0:66,419] The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five elements: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3) 

[11:1:66,429] Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief. 

[12:0:66,447] The Bureau of Firearms provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms/dangerous weapon 

[12:1:66,457] laws by conducting firearms eligibility background checks and administering over thirty different state-mandated firearms-

[12:2:66,467] related programs. The Bureau conducts firearms dealer and manufacturer inspections and provides training as needed. Special 

[12:3:66,477] Agents conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of weapons. 

[12:4:66,487] Agents also conduct firearms investigations to prevent illegal gun trafficking at in-state and out-of-state gun shows in 

[12:5:66,498] accordance with state and federal law. 

[13:0:66,515] The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence, including crime scene 

[13:1:66,525] investigation and expert court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts, by 

[13:2:66,536] operating 11 specialized laboratories that serve 46 counties as well as a forensic training facility. BFS maintains the state DNA 

[13:3:66,546] laboratory database which compiles DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees. 

[14:0:66,564] The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly and 

[14:1:66,574] is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and 

[14:2:66,584] business entities who apply for state gambling licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance 

[14:3:66,594] with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. Furthermore, the Bureau conducts criminal investigations in, on or 

[14:4:66,604] about Tribal casinos and California cardrooms. The Bureau also regulates Tribal gaming to ensure that each Tribe is in 

[14:5:66,615] compliance with all aspects of the negotiated gaming compact. 

[15:0:66,632] The Bureau of Investigation is the premiere investigative agency that is responsible for exploiting and dismantling criminal 

[15:1:66,642] organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses which present a significant and multi-

[15:2:66,653] jurisdictional threat to California. The Bureau prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal organizations involved in 

[15:3:66,663] gangs and human trafficking, as well as cases involving environmental crimes, public corruption, major fraud, underground 

[15:4:66,673] economy, and high-technology crimes. In addition, the Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership, coordination, and 

[15:5:66,683] support to law enforcement through multi-agency drug, gang and major crimes task forces statewide. 

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:216,43] 0845   Department of Insurance 

[2:0:66,64] California's publicly-elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the sixth largest insurance economy in the world with insurers 

[2:1:66,74] collecting more than $289 billion in premium annually in California while protecting consumers and the integrity, health and 

[2:2:66,84] vitality of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is "Insurance Protection for All 

[2:3:66,95] Californians." CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their dealings with 

[2:4:66,105] insurers, and using innovation to improve services for insurance producers and consumers. 

[3:0:66,123] The CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, the CDI oversees and licenses 

[3:1:66,133] approximately 1,300 insurance companies and more than 400,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents, 

[3:2:66,143] brokers, adjusters and bail agents. Additionally, the CDI receives and investigates approximately 200,000 consumer inquiries 

[3:3:66,153] and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than 28,000 

[3:4:66,163] suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 7,250 rate filing applications annually; and 

[3:5:66,174] works in conjunction with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute fraudulent insurance 

[3:6:66,184] practices.

[7:0:66,446] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[8:0:66,464] 0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS 

[9:0:66,481] The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of 

[9:1:66,492] insurers; (2) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and 

[9:2:66,502] casualty insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code 

[9:3:66,512] and the California Code of Regulations; (4) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are 

[9:4:66,522] reasonable and attempt to get unreasonable rates lowered by insurers; and (5) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, 

[9:5:66,532] and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and 

[9:6:66,543] Liquidation Office, the CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies. 

[9:7:66,560] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 

[10:0:66,578] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders 

[10:1:66,588] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating or 

[10:2:66,598] underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or fraudulent practices or 

[10:3:66,609] incompetence relating to the sale of insurance and (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities. 

[10:4:66,626] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 

[11:0:66,644] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 

[11:1:66,654] prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed 

[11:2:66,664] by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program also 

[11:3:66,675] implements the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower 

[11:4:66,685] "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud. 

[11:5:66,703] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE

[1:0:183,43] 0850   California State Lottery Commission 

[2:0:66,64] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an 

[2:1:66,74] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it 

[2:2:66,84] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to 

[2:3:66,95] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by 

[2:4:66,105] the State Senate. 

[3:0:66,125] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34 

[3:1:66,135] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be 

[3:2:66,146] used for administrative costs. 

[4:0:66,166] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost 

[4:1:66,176] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of 

[4:2:66,186] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery 

[4:3:66,197] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily 

[4:4:66,207] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the 

[4:5:66,217] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 

[5:0:66,237] In the 32 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2017, the California State Lottery has raised $32.5 billion 

[5:1:66,248] for public education, including $1.55 billion in FY 2016-17. 

[6:0:66,268] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2017-18 and 2018-19 cannot be made 

[6:1:66,278] with certainty.

[1:0:209,43] 0860   State Board of Equalization 

[2:0:66,64] Prior to July 1, 2017, the State Board of Equalization (BOE) administered a variety of tax and fee programs including the Sales 

[2:1:66,74] and Use tax, as required by statute. The BOE also adjudicated appeals for these tax and fee programs including income tax. 

[3:0:66,95] Pursuant to Chapter 16, Statutes of 2017, (AB 102) most statutory   duties formerly assigned to the BOE were shifted to the 

[3:1:66,105] newly created California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) and the Office of Tax Appeals. 

[4:0:66,125] The BOE now handles only those duties assigned to it by the California Constitution, and   three statutorily prescribed property 

[4:1:66,135] tax programs.   The BOE's duties   primarily include assessing and allocating the property values of railroads and specified 

[5:0:66,146] utilities and businesses; adjudicating property tax appeals of taxable government owned property; overseeing the property tax 

[5:1:66,156] assessment practices of the 58 county assessors; adopting rules to clarify property tax laws; and administering the alcoholic 

[6:0:66,166] beverage excise tax and the insurance tax, including appeals. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer the alcoholic 

[6:1:66,176] beverage tax and insurance tax program.

[8:0:66,358] Uniform Commercial Code files certain financing statements allowing lending institutions to protect their financial interest in 

[8:1:66,369] personal property and established priority in case of debtor default or bankruptcy. Notices of judgment liens, attachment liens, 

[8:2:66,379] agricultural liens, and equipment liens are also filed in Uniform Commercial Code, as well as notices of various tax liens 

[8:3:66,389] submitted by state and federal taxing agencies such as the Franchise Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service. 

[9:0:66,409] Notary Public and Special Filings appoints and commissions qualified notaries public for four- year terms, reviews and

[9:3:66,440] certain business entities are required to file, notices of joint power agreements, city and county charters, and claims for 

[9:4:66,450] successor-in-interest. This area also has disciplinary functions with regard to notaries public and immigration consultants. 

[10:0:66,471] The Advance Health Care Directive (AHCD) Registry maintains AHCDs, which allow a person to indicate his/her medical 

[10:1:66,481] treatment preferences if he/she cannot speak or make decisions for him/herself. The AHCD also may designate someone else 

[10:2:66,491] to make decisions regarding medical treatment. AHCDs and related information can be provided upon request to the 

[10:3:66,501] registrant's health care provider, public guardian, or legal representative. 

[11:0:66,522] The Domestic Partners Registry registers same-sex couples regardless of the age of the partners, and opposite-sex couples in

[4:0:66,178] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:0:66,196] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES 

[6:0:66,213] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption. 

[6:1:66,224] During the 2016-17 fiscal year, this Division handled 7,697 security investment transactions totaling $339.2 billion. The Pooled 

[6:2:66,234] Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 5,926 of these transactions totaling $295 billion; time deposits 

[6:3:66,244] accounted for 1,395 transactions totaling $34.2 billion. The remaining $10 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special 

[6:4:66,254] funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's 

[6:5:66,264] retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment 

[6:6:66,275] program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the 

[6:7:66,285] 2016-17 fiscal year, 2,439 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $21.8 billion for the fiscal year. 

[7:0:66,303] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 

[8:0:66,320] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 

[8:1:66,330] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 

[8:2:66,341] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 

[8:3:66,351] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits, 

[8:4:66,361] and loans to the General Fund. 

[9:0:66,379] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of 

[9:1:66,389] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that 

[9:2:66,399] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer 

[9:3:66,409] maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for 

[9:4:66,420] the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 

[10:0:66,437] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 

[10:1:66,447] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer 

[10:2:66,458] of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for 

[10:3:66,468] payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities 

[10:4:66,478] pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other 

[10:5:66,488] state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or 

[10:6:66,498] pledged to the state. 

[11:0:66,516] 0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 

[12:0:66,534] The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 

[12:1:66,544] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 

[12:2:66,554] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 

[12:3:66,564] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 

[13:0:66,582] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to state debt so there is no adverse consequences to 

[13:1:66,592] bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance for various state debt includes 

[13:2:66,603] monitoring the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial 

[13:3:66,613] disclosure, and ensuring proper record keeping. 

[14:0:66,630] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 

[15:0:66,648] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 

[15:1:66,658] services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems, 

[15:2:66,669] business services, technical support, and production operations. 

[16:0:66,686] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 

[17:0:66,704] As of the 2017-18 Governor's Budget, this program has been consolidated with the Administration and Information Services 

[17:1:66,714] Program (0740035).

[1:0:165,43] 0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee 

[2:0:66,64] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State 

[2:1:66,74] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit, 

[2:2:66,84] such as the creation of affordable housing. 

[3:0:66,102] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual 

[3:1:66,112] basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by 

[3:2:66,123] multiplying the state population by $100. California's limit totaled over $3.92 billion in 2017. (California's limit for the Qualified 

[3:3:66,133] Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $392 

[3:4:66,143] million for 2017.) 

[4:0:66,161] The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers 

[4:1:66,171] authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state 

[4:2:66,181] or federal government. 

[5:0:66,199] The Committee administers 10 programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity 

[5:1:66,209] bonds, and is responsible for reallocation of Qualified Energy Conservation Bond (QECB) authority, originally provided to 

[5:2:66,219] qualified localities, but later waived back to the state. The QECB program was made available through the federal American 

[5:3:66,229] Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It provides tax incentives and lower borrowing costs for local governments and 

[5:4:66,240] private entities to promote job creation and economic recovery in areas particularly affected by employment decline. It also 

[5:5:66,250] facilitates renewable energy conservation programs and projects throughout the state. 

[6:0:66,267] The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the Governor, or 

[6:1:66,278] upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,83] 0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 

[5:0:66,101] To lower the cost of financing, specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that 

[5:1:66,111] support below-market interest rate mortgage loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that reduce a homebuyer's federal 

[5:2:66,121] tax liability. Below is a summary of each program: 

[6:0:66,139] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily 

[6:1:66,149] rental housing to acquire land and construct new housing or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers 

[6:2:66,159] produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and 

[6:3:66,170] families. Projects that receive an award of bond authority have the right to apply for non-competitive 

[7:0:66,187] four-percent tax credits. 

[8:0:66,205] Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs to assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes. 

[8:1:66,215] Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program 

[8:2:66,225] participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations. 

[9:0:66,243] Home Improvement and Rehabilitation Bond Program - MRBs or MCCs to assist homeowners with home improvement 

[9:1:66,253] financing. Homeowners may improve single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. 

[9:2:66,263] Program participants must meet income limits, and in certain cases, must own a home that falls within the program's 

[9:3:66,274] rehabilitation cost and age-of-home limitations. 

[10:0:66,291] Extra Credit Home Purchase Program - MRBs or MCCs to assist teachers, principals and other eligible school staff with 

[10:1:66,302] purchasing homes. 

[11:0:66,319] Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds 

[11:1:66,329] issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and 

[11:2:66,340] midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their 

[11:3:66,350] communities. 

[12:0:66,368] Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance solid waste disposal and waste recycling 

[12:1:66,378] facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities 

[12:2:66,388] they serve to meet mandated requirements to protect and enhance the environment. 

[13:0:66,406] Student Loan Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued for either financing direct loans to college students and their 

[13:1:66,416] parents, or purchasing bundles of already-originated loans on the secondary market. When used for direct lending programs, 

[13:2:66,426] tax-exempt bond allocation allows lenders to pass on interest rate savings to students via below-market interest rate loans. 

[14:0:66,444] Beginning Farmer Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to back below-market interest rate loans for agricultural 

[14:1:66,454] land, construction improvements, breeder livestock, and equipment for farmers. Eligibility, permissible items, and loan limits are 

[14:2:66,464] set by the United States Internal Revenue Code. Under the program, a conduit bond issuer applies to the Committee for an 

[14:3:66,474] allocation of Beginning Farmer Bonds. If approved, the issuer brings together farmers, financial institutions, and investors to 

[14:4:66,485] negotiate terms of a transaction. 

[15:0:66,502] Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the construction, 

[15:1:66,512] renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities. 

[16:0:66,530] Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds or governmental purpose taxable bonds 

[16:1:66,540] issued to finance a broad array of qualified conservation purposes such as capital expenditures, research facilities and 

[16:2:66,551] research grant programs, mass commuting facilities, public education campaigns and demonstration projects. When issued as 

[16:3:66,561] a governmental purpose taxable bond, QECBs provide the issuer with either a direct or tax credit interest subsidy.

[1:0:96,43] 0965   California Industrial Development Financing Advisory Commission 

[1:1:66,64] The California Industrial Development Financing Advisory Commission creates employment opportunities and supports local 

[1:2:66,74] economic development by approving local entities' issuance of industrial development bonds. These bonds provide 

[1:3:66,84] manufacturers with a low-cost financing option to build, expand, or equip their facilities in California. The Commission 

[1:4:66,95] independently reviews bond applications to ensure compliance with federal tax law and state law, provides technical assistance 

[1:5:66,105] to bond issuers, and approves the bond sales by local authorities. 

[2:0:66,123] The State Treasurer serves as chairperson of the Commission. The other members are the Director of the Department of 

[2:1:66,133] Finance, the State Controller, the Director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, and the 

[2:2:66,143] Commissioner of the Department of Business Oversight.

[8:0:66,409] 0830 - CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCING ADVISORY COMMISSION 

[9:0:66,426] The core program area is the Industrial Development Bond Program, under which the Commission serves as the mandatory 

[9:1:66,437] approval agency for the local bond issuers. Once potential borrowers (manufacturers and processing companies) apply through 

[9:2:66,447] their local government agency for low cost tax-exempt financing, the Commission carefully reviews the public benefits 

[9:3:66,457] generated by the proposed project, particularly those benefits associated with job creation, and determines whether these 

[9:4:66,467] benefits will significantly outweigh any detrimental public effects. Eligible capital expenditures include the acquisition of land, 

[9:5:66,477] building construction, building renovation, and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Bond proceeds also can be used to 

[9:6:66,488] cover the cost of architects, engineers, attorneys, permits, and the cost of bond issuance. The local issuer can be a city, county, 

[9:7:66,498] economic development authority, or a joint power authority.

[1:0:166,43] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee 

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and 

[2:1:66,74] maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming 

[2:2:66,84] partnerships with developers, investors and public entities. 

[3:0:66,102] The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years 

[3:1:66,112] after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with income and rent restrictions related to the tax credit programs of the 

[3:2:66,123] Committee. Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create 

[3:3:66,133] and maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing. 

[4:0:66,150] The Committee consists of seven members, including three voting members and four advisors. The voting members are the 

[4:1:66,161] Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her 

[5:0:66,171] representative), and the State Controller. The non-voting (advisory) members are the Director of Housing and Community 

[5:1:66,181] Development, the Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and two local government representatives. 

[5:2:66,191] One local representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a 

[5:3:66,201] county government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

[1:0:410,24] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — LJE   245 

[2:0:131,38] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[3:1:66,83] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 

[3:2:66,101] The Federal Program 

[4:0:66,119] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax 

[4:1:66,129] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise 

[4:2:66,139] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and 

[4:3:66,149] indexed for inflation. For 2018, each state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.40 per state resident. Additionally, each 

[4:4:66,159] state may qualify annually for a share of unused credits in a national pool. 

[4:5:66,177] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the 

[4:6:66,187] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability 

[4:7:66,197] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of 

[4:8:66,208] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project 

[4:9:66,218] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each 

[4:10:66,228] year for a ten-year period. 

[4:11:66,246] The State LIHTC Program 

[5:0:66,263] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the 

[5:1:66,274] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for 

[5:2:66,284] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax 

[5:3:66,294] credit status. 

[6:0:66,312] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2017, was $96.5 million. Investors take the state tax credit 

[6:1:66,322] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period. 

[6:2:66,340] Tax-Exempt Bond Financed Program 

[7:0:66,357] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may also receive federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects 

[7:1:66,368] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there 

[7:2:66,378] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. The annual credit available 

[7:3:66,388] is based on approximately 4 percent of the qualified basis of the development. The qualified basis includes those costs 

[7:4:66,398] attributable to the units that will be income and rent restricted for a minimum of 30 years. 

[7:5:66,416] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years; however, California's program generally requires 

[7:6:66,426] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance. 

[7:7:66,444] Farmworker Housing Program 

[8:0:66,461] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state 

[8:1:66,472] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017, 

[8:2:66,482] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and 

[8:3:66,492] projects may receive state credits even if they receive an increase in their federal tax credit basis.

[1:1:279,57] Authority 

[2:0:66,78] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes 

[2:1:66,89] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently 

[2:2:66,99] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the 

[2:3:66,109] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 

[2:4:66,119] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources, 

[2:5:66,129] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and 

[2:6:66,140] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit 

[2:7:66,150] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities 

[2:8:66,160] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 

[3:0:66,178] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director 

[3:1:66,188] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 

[3:2:66,198] and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[5:0:66,132] 0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 

[5:1:66,150] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the 

[5:2:66,160] authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as 

[5:3:66,170] determined and approved by resolution of the Authority. 

[6:0:66,188] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative 

[6:1:66,198] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012, expanded 

[6:2:66,208] the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 

[6:3:66,218] 768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock 

[6:4:66,229] and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. The objective of this program is to 

[6:5:66,239] promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, 

[6:6:66,249] air and water pollution, and energy consumption. 

[7:0:66,267] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013 

[7:1:66,277] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority 

[7:2:66,287] developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for residential 

[7:3:66,297] whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for residential Property 

[7:4:66,308] Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. 

[8:0:66,325] Most recently, the Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf 

[8:1:66,335] of, and in collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot programs will 

[8:2:66,346] employ various types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and 

[8:3:66,356] commercial sectors) for energy efficiency improvements needed to help achieve California's energy efficiency goals.

[2:0:66,64] California Pollution Control Financing Authority is committed to stimulating local economies in California by making capital more 

[2:1:66,74] accessible to small businesses, and delivering innovative financing for projects that protect and restore the environment. The 

[2:2:66,84] Authority was created to assist the solid waste, recycling, water, and wastewater industries through its Pollution Control Tax-

[2:3:66,95] Exempt Bond Program. Over the last twenty years, the Authority has evolved to provide financing assistance to California's 

[2:4:66,105] small business sector through its California Capital Access Program (CalCAP), and to promote the reuse and redevelopment of 

[2:5:66,115] brownfields through the California Recycle Underutilized Sites Program (CALReUSE). 

[3:0:66,133] The Authority consists of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the State Controller, and the Director of the Department of 

[3:1:66,143] Finance.

[14:0:66,696] The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the 

[14:1:66,707] acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment,

[2:0:116,38] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority 

[3:1:66,75] assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989. 

[3:2:66,85] As of June 30, 2017, bonds totaling approximately $15.3 billion have been issued by the Authority. 

[4:0:66,103] 0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 

[5:0:66,121] The objective of this program is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. CalCAP 

[5:1:66,131] for Small Businesses is a form of loan loss recovery that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By 

[5:2:66,141] participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the financing needs of 

[5:3:66,151] California's small businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating 

[5:4:66,161] financial institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional 

[5:5:66,172] incentives are provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk, 

[5:6:66,182] allowing banks to lend to targeted California small businesses. Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General 

[5:7:66,192] Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts. As of June 30, 2017, approximately $1.877 million of the $6 million remained in the 

[5:8:66,202] State-funded program account to assist small businesses. 

[6:0:66,220] In addition, California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168.6 million from the federal State Small 

[6:1:66,230] Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The Authority and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (Go-BIZ) 

[6:2:66,240] equally share this allocation of $84.3 million each. These funds have enabled the Authority to expand the availability of its 

[6:3:66,251] CalCAP program statewide. The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to assist more small businesses and 

[6:4:66,261] utilize the SSBCI federal funds. Funds were allocated to California in three installments based on program progress. The 

[6:5:66,271] Authority received $27 million in March 2011, $27 million in December 2013, and $29 million in August 2015. The Authority was 

[6:6:66,281] allocated an additional $321,000 in December 2016, the final receipt of federal funds under the SSBCI program. As of June 30, 

[6:7:66,291] 2017, approximately $900,000 remained in the federally-funded program account to assist small businesses under the CalCAP 

[6:8:66,302] loan loss reserve program. Approximately $5 million remained in the federally-funded program account for the Collateral 

[6:9:66,312] Support Program. Funds are being recaptured to sustain the programs. 

[7:0:66,329] Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck and 

[7:1:66,340] equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $107.3 million in Air Quality Improvement 

[7:2:66,350] Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The 

[7:3:66,360] Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit 

[7:4:66,370] enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations. Similarly, the Authority is 

[7:5:66,380] partnering with the Department of Resources, Recycling, and Recovery to assist with the financing of important state recycling 

[7:6:66,391] objectives. 

[8:0:66,408] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 

[9:0:66,426] The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived 

[9:1:66,436] contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties 

[9:2:66,446] (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program 

[9:3:66,457] provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000, which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with 

[9:4:66,467] brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible 

[9:5:66,477] projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or 

[9:6:66,487] perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process. 

[10:0:66,505] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund 

[11:0:66,515] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received 

[11:1:66,525] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided up to $5 million per project in loans and grants for the purpose of brownfield 

[11:2:66,536] cleanup that promotes affordable infill residential and mixed-used development. All CALReUSE Program funds have been 

[11:3:66,546] awarded. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,618 housing units 

[11:4:66,556] in 30 California communities. 

[12:0:66,574] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 

[13:0:66,591] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative 

[13:1:66,602] energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's 

[13:2:66,612] environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and 

[13:3:66,622] state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 

[14:0:66,640] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT 

[15:0:66,657] The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal 

[15:1:66,668] Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other 

[15:2:66,678] financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the 

[15:3:66,688] Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the 

[15:4:66,698] CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program.

[3:1:66,83] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time 

[3:2:66,93] allocation of $10 million to create an accessible loan program to qualified small businesses and residential property owners 

[3:3:66,103] (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of Housing and Community 

[3:4:66,113] Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other financial institutions to 

[3:5:66,123] participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program. The loans to small 

[3:6:66,134] businesses and residential property owners are for financing seismic retrofits of real property to reduce losses and mitigate 

[3:7:66,144] seismic damage.

[3:0:66,84] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,102] 0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM 

[5:0:66,123] In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3 

[5:1:66,133] established the second Children's Hospital Program. The purpose of both programs is to improve the health and welfare of 

[5:2:66,143] California's critically ill children by providing a stable and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's 

[5:3:66,153] hospitals. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 

[5:4:66,164] million under Proposition 61 and $980 million under Proposition 3. 

[6:0:66,181] 0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES GRANTS AND LOANS 

[7:0:66,202] The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health 

[7:1:66,212] institutions. 

[8:0:66,232] Tax-Exempt Bond Program 

[9:0:66,253] Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of 

[9:1:66,263] the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of 

[9:2:66,273] the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or 

[9:3:66,283] association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district. 

[10:0:66,304] Lifeline Grant Program 

[11:0:66,324] Chapter 52, Statutes of 2017 (SB 97) authorized the Authority to approve grants of up to $20 million dollars from the HELP II 

[11:1:66,334] Loan Program subfund account. The Lifeline Grant Program will assist small and rural health facilities, including community-

[11:2:66,344] based clinics, that may be adversely affected financially by a reduction or elimination of federal government assistance and that 

[11:3:66,355] have little to no access to working capital. Grants must be awarded by June 30, 2020.

[13:1:66,645] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 

[14:0:66,662] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which 

[14:1:66,672] allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can 

[14:2:66,683] make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings. 

[14:3:66,693] ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability 

[14:4:66,703] expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the 

[14:5:66,713] State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program (the Program) accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.

[8:0:66,366] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[9:0:66,384] 0900 - The Authority was established to issue up to $650 million in conduit financing to make loans or acquire title to property 

[9:1:66,394] and to underwrite or undertake directly a variety of urban waterfront development projects within the coastal zone, the 

[9:2:66,405] Sacramento-Yolo Port District, the Stockton Port District, and those metropolitan statistical areas meeting specified conditions. 

[9:3:66,415] The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that bonds authorized by the Authority generally be within an allocation from the 

[9:4:66,425] state's ''private activity'' bond limit in order for the bonds to be federally tax-exempt, unless the issuer qualifies as a private, 

[9:5:66,435] nonprofit business. 

[10:0:66,453] Financing is available for both publicly and privately sponsored projects that provide visitor-serving facilities, waterfront-

[10:1:66,463] dependent industries, public recreation, and erosion control facilities. The State Coastal Conservancy must approve both the 

[10:2:66,473] specific project and a master plan for urban waterfront restoration before any project can obtain the Authority approval for 

[10:3:66,483] revenue bond financing. The Authority has sold $3.33 million in revenue bonds to date.

[5:0:66,215] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:1:66,233] 0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM 

[6:0:66,253] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance 

[6:1:66,263] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and 

[6:2:66,274] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities, 

[6:3:66,284] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB 

[6:4:66,294] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs. 

[6:5:66,312] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM 

[7:0:66,329] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program 

[7:1:66,340] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the 

[7:2:66,350] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University 

[7:3:66,360] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50 

[7:4:66,370] percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the 

[7:5:66,380] state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be 

[7:6:66,391] deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements. 

[7:7:66,408] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 

[8:0:66,426] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School 

[8:1:66,436] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs. 

[8:2:66,446] Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities 

[8:3:66,457] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on 

[8:4:66,467] preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and 

[8:5:66,477] demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. 

[8:6:66,495] 0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM 

[9:0:66,512] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and 

[9:1:66,523] lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged 

[9:2:66,533] students. Eligible charter schools are provided up to $1,145 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, not to exceed 75 

[9:3:66,543] percent of their total annual facilities rent or lease costs. 

[9:4:66,561] 0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND 

[10:0:66,578] Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of 

[10:1:66,589] up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is 

[10:2:66,599] available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference is given to schools that 

[10:3:66,609] have not completed their full charter term.

[12:1:66,613] 0940 - BOND FINANCING 

[13:0:66,631] CEFA issues revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning construct educational facilities. Because 

[13:1:66,641] it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, the Authority may be able to provide more favorable financing terms than might 

[13:2:66,651] otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the 

[13:3:66,662] construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or 

[13:4:66,672] the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating 

[13:5:66,682] institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private 

[13:6:66,692] activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law.

[1:0:410,24] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — LJE   277 

[2:0:133,38] 0989   California Educational Facilities Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private 

[3:1:66,75] college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on his or her race or ethnicity, provided that the financing does 

[3:2:66,85] not violate constitutional provisions. 

[4:0:66,103] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to 

[4:1:66,113] issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than 

[4:2:66,123] these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 

[4:3:66,141] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 

[5:0:66,159] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the 

[5:1:66,169] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015, 

[5:2:66,179] added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 

[5:3:66,189] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax 

[5:4:66,200] credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
