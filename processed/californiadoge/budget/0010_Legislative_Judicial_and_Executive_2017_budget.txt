[6:0:137,259] 0150 Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System 

[6:1:58,279] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional 

[6:2:58,288] officers, and legislative statutory officers. 

[7:0:58,306] The Legislators' Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment 

[7:1:58,315] earnings. Between 2000-01 and 2011-12, the Legislators' Retirement System was super-funded and neither the state nor 

[7:2:58,324] members were required to contribute. Beginning in 2012-13, contributions resumed for the state and members. 

[7:3:58,342] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf 

[7:4:58,351] of its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death, 

[7:5:58,360] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. 

[7:6:58,378] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after 

[7:7:58,387] November 6, 1990. 

[8:0:58,405] Effective January 1, 2013, the Legislators' Retirement System was closed to all new members by the California Public 

[8:1:58,414] Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340). New constitutional officers, statutory 

[8:2:58,423] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[5:1:58,257] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members 

[5:2:58,266] and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. 

[5:3:58,275] The legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of 

[5:4:58,284] legislative committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all 

[5:5:58,293] work is confidential. 

[6:0:58,311] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative 

[6:1:58,320] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes. 

[7:0:58,338] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the 

[7:1:58,347] legislative information system and the processing of legislative measures. 

[8:0:58,365] Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the 

[8:1:58,374] Legislative Counsel Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws 

[8:2:58,383] recommended by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these

[8:0:241,435] 0250 Judicial Branch 

[8:1:58,456] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power 

[8:2:58,465] of the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial 

[8:3:58,474] system. Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person 

[8:4:58,483] financially unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 

[9:0:58,501] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 

[9:1:58,510] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of operation of the trial 

[9:2:58,519] courts was implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. 

[9:3:58,528] This implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 

[9:4:58,537] level. The county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and 

[9:5:58,546] penalty revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly 

[9:6:58,555] payments to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, 

[9:7:58,564] as adjusted by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial 

[9:8:58,573] Court Facilities Act of 2002 (Chapter 1082, Statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be 

[9:9:58,582] transferred from the counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, 

[10:0:58,591] Statutes of 2008. The Trial Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, which went into effect 

[10:1:58,600] on January 1, 2003. These revenues are deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of 

[10:2:58,609] funding the construction and maintenance of court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the 

[11:0:58,618] ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 

[11:1:58,636] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law 

[12:0:58,645] consistently, impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California 

[12:1:58,654] and the United States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 

[13:0:58,672] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 

[13:1:58,681] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[21:0:82,590] 1/ Reflects the 2015-16 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the superior courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for Fiscal Year 2015-16. Non-state  

[21:1:82,596] funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[22:0:82,602] 2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees. 

[22:1:82,608] 3/ Reflects the budgets of all 57 superior courts based on courts' 2016-17 Schedule 1 submissions as of November 28, 2016. 

[23:0:82,615] 4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 above in anticipation of their allocation. 

[24:0:82,622] 5/ Reflects half of total funding ($21.4 million). Allocation pending updated workload metrics from the courts related to 2016-17. 

[25:0:82,628] 6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’ state  

[25:1:82,634] funding in Section 1. 

[25:2:82,639] 7/ 

[25:3:84,640]  See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and  

[25:4:82,645] Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total  

[25:5:82,651] expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total". 

[25:6:82,656] 8/ 

[25:7:84,657]  For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences. For the current  

[25:8:82,662] year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[26:0:82,667] 9/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2015-16 and estimated expenditures for 2016-17 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" (as well as Program 0140019 "Trial Court Operations" for FY 2015-16) included in the 2017-18

[10:0:55,194] 1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" as well as Program 0140019 "Trial Court Operations" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF),  

[10:1:55,202] General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers' Compensation Fund (JBWCF). The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses as those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is  

[10:2:55,209] made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). 

[11:0:55,219] 2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions"  

[11:1:55,226] display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State  

[11:2:55,233] Trial Court Funding Total".  

[12:0:55,243] 3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the  

[12:1:55,251] Trial Court Information section ($113.5 million in 2015-16 and $119.1 million in 2016-17). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In  

[12:2:55,257] addition, 26 courts in 2015-16 and 25 courts in 2016-17 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF. 

[13:0:55,273] 4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program.  

[13:1:55,281] Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. 

[14:0:55,292] 5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF. For  

[14:1:55,299] the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.

[1:0:206,44] 0250 Judicial Branch - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 0130 - SUPREME COURT 

[4:0:58,127] The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California 

[4:1:58,136] state courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions 

[4:2:58,145] from the Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and 

[4:3:58,154] recommendations for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to 

[4:4:58,163] settle legal questions of statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are 

[4:5:58,172] appealed directly to the Supreme Court. 

[5:0:58,190] 0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 

[6:0:58,208] Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The 

[6:1:58,217] six District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases 

[6:2:58,226] before the Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 

[7:0:58,244] 0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 

[8:0:58,262] The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 

[8:1:58,271] voting members and 11 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve 

[8:2:58,280] as the administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the 

[8:3:58,289] operation of the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; 

[8:4:58,298] and administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired 

[8:5:58,307] judges, technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 

[9:0:58,325] Consistent with the judiciary's mission, the Judicial Council is guided by the following principles: 

[10:0:58,341] • 

[10:1:58,350] • 

[11:0:68,343] To make decisions in the best interests of the public and the court system as a whole. 

[12:0:68,352] To conduct the Council's business based on an underlying commitment to equal and timely justice and public access to 

[12:1:68,361] an independent forum for the resolution of disputes. 

[13:0:58,368] • 

[14:0:68,370] To provide leadership in the administration of justice by planning and advocating for policies and resources that are 

[14:1:68,379] necessary for courts to fulfill their mission. 

[15:0:58,386] • 

[16:0:68,388] To ensure the continued development of an accessible, independent court system through planning, research, and 

[16:1:68,397] evaluation programs, and through the use of modern management approaches and technological developments. 

[16:2:68,406] To provide leadership in the administration of justice by establishing broad and consistent policies for the operation of the 

[16:3:68,415] courts and appropriate uniform statewide rules and forms.

[11:0:58,502] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[12:0:58,521] The Judicial Council facilities consist of the offices of its staff, the Supreme Court, the Courts of Appeal, the Habeas Corpus 

[12:1:58,530] Resource Center, the Commission on Judicial Performance, and all Trial Courts statewide. The Supreme Court is located in 

[12:2:58,539] the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco (98,000 square feet) and the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los Angeles (7,600 

[12:3:58,548] sf). The Courts of Appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of approximately 

[12:4:58,557] 508,000 sf. The Trial Courts are located in 58 counties statewide consisting of more than 500 buildings and 2,100 

[12:5:58,566] courtrooms and approximately 14 million sf of usable area. The space includes public areas, such as courtrooms, waiting 

[12:6:58,575] areas, clerks' offices, child waiting, records viewing, rooms for jury assembly and deliberation, and centers for self-help, 

[12:7:58,584] alternative dispute resolution, and mediation, as well as private areas, such as judicial officer chambers, staff workspace, 

[12:8:58,593] storage space, training rooms, and conference rooms. Judicial Council staff facilities, occupying approximately 255,000 sf, 

[12:9:58,602] are located in San Francisco (Headquarters), Sacramento, and field offices throughout the state. Judicial Council 

[12:10:58,611] responsibility and management has gradually increased to what is now approximately 20 million square feet of facility space 

[12:11:58,620] statewide.

[3:0:178,149] 0280 Commission on Judicial Performance 

[4:0:58,170] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating 

[4:1:58,179] complaints of judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the 

[4:2:58,188] California Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and 

[4:3:58,197] justices of California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to 

[4:4:58,206] retirement or resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court 

[4:5:58,215] commissioners and referees. In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' 

[4:6:58,224] applications for disability retirement. 

[5:0:58,242] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. 

[5:1:58,251] Judicial misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After 

[5:2:58,260] investigation and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential 

[5:3:58,269] discipline to removal from office. 

[6:0:58,287] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the 

[6:1:58,296] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, 

[6:2:58,305] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms. 

[6:3:58,314] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[8:0:148,410] 0390 Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System 

[8:1:58,430] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and 

[8:2:58,439] Superior/Municipal courts. 

[9:0:58,457] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, 

[9:1:58,466] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active 

[9:2:58,475] judges and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come 

[9:3:58,484] from filing fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund 

[9:4:58,493] benefit payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources 

[9:5:58,502] and the required benefit payments to retired judges. 

[10:0:58,520] A second retirement system for judges was established in 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 

[10:1:58,529] 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, 

[10:2:58,538] disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific 

[10:3:58,547] sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Members not eligible for a defined benefit receive the balance of their 

[10:4:58,556] monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives contributions from judges equal to 8 

[10:5:58,565] percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted annually to maintain actuarial 

[10:6:58,574] soundness of the fund. Judges' Retirement System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing 

[10:7:58,583] the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. 

[11:0:58,601] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes 

[11:1:58,610] of 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[6:0:58,296] • 

[7:0:68,298] The Budget includes an increase to the state's contribution due to the CalPERS Board's action in 2017 to lower the 

[7:1:68,307] assumed rate of return for the Judges' Retirement System II. The assumption change increased the system's liabilities, 

[7:2:68,316] resulting in an increase to the state's funding obligation.

[7:0:115,346] 0530 Secretary for California Health and Human Services Agency 

[8:0:58,367] The primary mission of the Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is to provide policy leadership and direction to the 

[8:1:58,376] departments, board and programs it oversees, to reduce duplication and fragmentation among HHSA departments in policy 

[8:2:58,385] development and implementation, to improve coordination among departments on common programs, to ensure 

[8:3:58,394] programmatic integrity, and to advance the Governor's priorities on health and human services issues. 

[9:0:58,412] The HHSA accomplishes its mission through the administration and coordination of state and federal programs for public 

[9:1:58,421] health, health care services, social services, public assistance, health planning and licensing, and rehabilitation. These 

[10:0:58,430] programs touch the lives of millions of California's most needy and vulnerable residents. The HHSA is committed to striking 

[10:1:58,439] a balance between maintaining access to essential health and human services for California's most disadvantaged and at-

[10:2:58,448] risk residents while pursuing ways to better manage and control costs.

[12:0:58,555] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[13:0:68,571] • 

[14:0:78,573] The Budget establishes a new Natural Resources and Parks Preservation Fund, which is a "pay as you go" special 

[14:1:78,582] fund to support natural resources programs previously funded by bond measures, such as water and flood 

[14:2:78,591] management, parks, forestry, land preservation, wildlife habitat, and climate adaptation. This new approach will be cost 

[14:3:78,600] effective, as the state will get double the value for each dollar compared to bond financing. The amount of funding 

[14:4:78,609] allocated for this Fund will be determined on a year-to-year basis.

[7:0:198,266] 0552 Office of the Inspector General 

[7:1:58,286] The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional 

[7:2:58,295] system. The OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and 

[7:3:58,304] Rehabilitation's (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, and the employee disciplinary process. When requested 

[7:4:58,313] by the Governor, the Senate Committee on Rules, or the Speaker of the Assembly, the Inspector General reviews the 

[7:5:58,322] policies, practices, and procedures of the CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment 

[7:6:58,331] to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the state's juvenile facilities; 

[7:7:58,340] conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at each state prison and the 

[7:8:58,349] delivery of reforms implemented by the CDCR since 2012. The OIG receives communications from individuals alleging 

[7:9:58,358] improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by 

[7:10:58,367] employees of the CDCR; conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper 

[7:11:58,376] management where a legally cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews the mishandling of sexual abuse incidents 

[7:12:58,385] within correctional institutions. The OIG provides critical public transparency for the state correctional system by publicly 

[7:13:58,394] reporting its findings. 

[8:0:58,412] In addition, the OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various 

[8:1:58,421] mental health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at 

[8:2:58,430] least twice annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment 

[8:3:58,439] programs. The Board also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on 

[8:4:58,448] the effectiveness of treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of 

[8:5:58,457] offender participation and success.

[6:0:201,292] 0690 Office of Emergency Services 

[6:1:58,312] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (OES) is to protect lives and property, build capabilities, and 

[6:2:58,321] support our communities for a resilient California. The OES Director serves as both the Governor's Homeland Security 

[6:3:58,330] Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's homeland security 

[6:4:58,339] and counter-terrorism strategy. The OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting 

[6:5:58,348] against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats. 

[7:0:58,366] On a day-to-day basis, the OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and 

[7:1:58,375] coordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private 

[7:2:58,384] sector resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction 

[7:3:58,393] relies first on its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The OES' plans and programs are 

[7:4:58,402] coordinated with those of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within 

[7:5:58,411] California. 

[8:0:58,429] During an emergency, the OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 

[8:1:58,438] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 

[8:2:58,447] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, the OES is responsible for the 

[9:0:58,456] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 

[9:1:58,465] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 

[10:0:58,483] The OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), 

[10:1:58,492] which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and 

[10:2:58,501] one major urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and 

[10:3:58,510] terrorist activity; and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector 

[10:4:58,519] partners. The STAC operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-

[10:5:58,528] terrorism, situational awareness reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety 

[10:6:58,537] community. Further, the OES improves the criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical 

[10:7:58,546] assistance to local governments, state agencies, and the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim 

[10:8:58,555] services. 

[11:0:58,573] Because the OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to 

[11:1:58,582] support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 

[4:0:58,127] Through the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program, the OES provides effective use of federal, 

[4:1:58,136] state, and local resources, through the mutual aid system to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended in 

[4:2:58,145] a disaster situation. Also, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-hazards 

[4:3:58,154] approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National Strategy 

[4:4:58,163] on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this 

[4:5:58,172] program, the OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response 

[4:6:58,181] to all hazards. 

[5:0:58,199] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 

[6:0:58,217] The OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim 

[6:1:58,226] services grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department 

[6:2:58,235] of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, the OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, 

[6:3:58,244] emergency management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its 

[6:4:58,253] grant management role, the OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 

[6:5:58,262] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center which is the 

[6:6:58,271] centerpiece of the State's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary 

[6:7:58,280] fusion center. 

[7:0:58,298] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 

[8:0:58,316] Public Safety Communications (PSC) serves the State of California by providing public safety communications to the State's 

[8:1:58,325] first responders and oversight of the 9-1-1 system to the people of California. The PSC is dedicated to the preservation and 

[8:2:58,334] protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services keeping the public 

[8:3:58,343] connected during times of crisis. 

[8:4:58,361] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE

[2:2:58,91] DNA laboratory database which compiles DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees. 

[3:0:58,109] The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly 

[3:1:58,118] and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and 

[3:2:58,127] business entities who apply for state gambling licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance 

[3:3:58,136] with the Gambling Control Act. Furthermore, the Bureau conducts criminal investigations in, on or about Tribal casinos and

[4:3:58,199] in gangs and human trafficking, as well as cases involving environmental crimes, public corruption, major fraud, 

[5:0:58,208] underground economy, and high-technology crimes. In addition, the Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership, 

[5:1:58,217] coordination, and support to law enforcement through multi-agency drug, gang and major crimes task forces statewide. 

[6:0:58,235] The Office of the Director enhances public safety by providing training, technical, and administrative support to the 

[7:0:58,244] investigative, regulatory and forensic components of the Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies.

[6:1:58,329] California's publicly-elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the sixth largest insurance economy in the world with 

[6:2:58,338] insurers collecting more than $288 billion in premium annually in California while protecting consumers and the integrity, 

[6:3:58,347] health and vitality of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is "Insurance 

[6:4:58,356] Protection for All Californians." CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in 

[6:5:58,365] their dealings with insurers, and using innovation to improve services for insurance producers and consumers. 

[6:6:58,383] The CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, the CDI oversees and 

[6:7:58,392] licenses approximately 1,300 insurance companies and more than 400,000 individuals and business entities as insurance 

[6:8:58,401] agents, brokers, adjusters and bail agents. Additionally, the CDI receives and investigates approximately 200,000 consumer 

[6:9:58,410] inquiries and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than 

[6:10:58,419] 30,000 suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 7,250 rate filing applications 

[6:11:58,428] annually; and works in conjunction with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute 

[6:12:58,437] fraudulent insurance practices.

[1:0:180,44] 0845 Department of Insurance - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of 

[2:1:58,91] insurers; (2) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and 

[2:2:58,100] casualty insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance 

[2:3:58,109] Code and the California Code of Regulations; (4) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are 

[2:4:58,118] reasonable and attempt to get unreasonable rates lowered by insurers; and (5) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, 

[2:5:58,127] and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and 

[2:6:58,136] Liquidation Office, the CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies. 

[2:7:58,154] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 

[3:0:58,172] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance 

[3:1:58,181] policyholders and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims 

[3:2:58,190] handling, rating or underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or 

[3:3:58,199] fraudulent practices or incompetence relating to the sale of insurance. 

[3:4:58,217] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 

[4:0:58,235] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 

[4:1:58,244] prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily 

[4:2:58,253] staffed by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The 

[4:3:58,262] program also implements the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in 

[4:4:58,271] whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud. 

[4:5:58,289] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 

[5:0:58,307] This program performs tax collection; ensures compliance from insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws 

[5:1:58,316] contained in the Insurance Code and Revenue and Taxation Code; and works with the Board of Equalization and State 

[5:2:58,325] Controller's Office with various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the premium tax program. Tax 

[5:3:58,334] collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund. 

[5:4:58,352] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION

[0:0:58,15] LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE   2017-18 STATE BUDGET — LJE 169 

[1:0:182,44] 0850 California State Lottery Commission 

[2:0:58,64] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an 

[2:1:58,73] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it 

[2:2:58,82] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies 

[2:3:58,91] to benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed 

[2:4:58,100] by the State Senate. 

[3:0:58,118] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 

[3:1:58,127] 34 percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were 

[3:2:58,136] to be used for administrative costs. 

[4:0:58,154] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative 

[4:1:58,163] cost limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels 

[4:2:58,172] of contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery 

[4:3:58,181] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily 

[4:4:58,190] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the 

[4:5:58,199] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 

[5:0:58,217] In the 31 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2016, the California State Lottery has raised nearly $31 

[5:1:58,226] billion for public education, including $1.59 billion in FY 2015-16. 

[6:0:58,244] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2016-17 and 2017-18 cannot be made 

[6:1:58,253] with certainty.

[4:0:207,133] 0860 State Board of Equalization 

[4:1:58,153] Prior to July 1, 2017, the State Board of Equalization (BOE) administered various tax and fee programs including the Sales 

[4:2:58,162] and Use tax, adopted rules and regulations to clarify tax laws, acted as an appellate body for the review of property, 

[4:3:58,171] business and income tax assessments, assessed and allocated the property values of railroads and specified utilities and 

[4:4:58,180] businesses, and oversaw the property tax assessment practices of all 58 county assessors. 

[5:0:58,198] Effective July 1, 2017, legislation enacted as part of the 2017 Budget Act recast the BOE as the California Department of 

[5:1:58,207] Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). The CDTFA will perform those statutory duties formerly assigned to the BOE, except 

[5:2:58,216] for tax appeals. The BOE will continue in existence, but will handle only those duties assigned to it by the California 

[5:3:58,225] Constitution, namely the assessment and allocation of the property values of railroads and specified utilities and businesses, 

[5:4:58,234] and the oversight of the property tax assessment practices of all 58 county assessors.

[3:0:58,125] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[4:0:58,141] • 

[5:0:68,144] Legislation enacted concurrent with the 2017 Budget Act recast the State Board of Equalization (BOE) as the California 

[5:1:68,153] Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) effective July 1, 2017. The CDTFA will have a Director appointed by 

[5:2:68,162] the Governor, and it will operate under the Government Operations Agency. The CDTFA will perform those statutory 

[5:3:68,171] duties previously performed by the BOE, other than tax appeals, which will be assigned to the newly created Office of Tax 

[5:4:68,180] Appeals effective January 1, 2018. The BOE will remain in existence, but it will be responsible only for those duties 

[5:5:68,189] assigned to it by the California Constitution. The BOE will house the Board Members and their staff, together with those 

[5:6:68,198] current BOE civil service employees who work in those programs still under the BOE's jurisdiction. All other BOE civil 

[5:7:68,207] service employees will transition to the CDTFA. Both the CDTFA and the BOE will be funded in 2017-18 from the 

[5:8:68,216] appropriations provided by the 0860 Budget Unit.

[8:0:58,177] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:0:58,204] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES 

[10:0:58,222] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of 

[10:1:58,231] redemption. During the 2015-16 fiscal year, this Division handled 7,359 security investment transactions totaling $312.9 

[10:2:58,240] billion. The Pooled Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 5,337 of these transactions totaling $266.1 

[10:3:58,249] billion; time deposits accounted for 1,599 transactions totaling $37.5 billion. The remaining $9.3 billion is invested on behalf 

[10:4:58,258] of the state's special funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish 

[10:5:58,267] and Wildlife, the state's retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a 

[10:6:58,276] voluntary investment program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the 

[10:7:58,285] PMIB program. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, 2,479 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $20.9 billion for 

[10:8:58,294] the fiscal year. 

[11:0:58,312] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 

[12:0:58,330] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 

[12:1:58,339] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 

[12:2:58,348] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 

[12:3:58,357] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank 

[12:4:58,366] deposits, and loans to the General Fund. 

[13:0:58,384] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal 

[13:1:58,393] of the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure 

[13:2:58,402] that the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The State 

[13:3:58,411] Treasurer maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository 

[13:4:58,420] coverage for the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 

[14:0:58,438] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 

[14:1:58,447] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire 

[14:2:58,456] transfer of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting 

[14:3:58,465] banks for payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) 

[14:4:58,474] and securities pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, 

[14:5:58,483] demand, and other state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal 

[14:6:58,492] property owned by or pledged to the state. 

[15:0:58,510] 0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 

[16:0:58,528] The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 

[16:1:58,537] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 

[16:2:58,546] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 

[16:3:58,555] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 

[17:0:58,573] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to state debt so there is no adverse consequences to 

[17:1:58,582] bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance for various state debt includes 

[17:2:58,591] monitoring the use of bond proceeds, monitoring use of bond financed property, tracking expenditures, managing rebate and 

[17:3:58,600] yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and ensuring proper record keeping. 

[18:0:58,618] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 

[19:0:58,636] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 

[19:1:58,645] services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information 

[19:2:58,654] systems, business services, technical support, and production operations. 

[20:0:58,672] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 

[21:0:58,690] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 

[21:1:58,699] services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information 

[21:2:58,708] systems, business services, technical support, and production operations. Starting with the 2017-18 Governor's Budget, the

[5:0:163,213] 0959 California Debt Limit Allocation Committee 

[6:0:58,233] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt private activity bond authority for the State 

[6:1:58,242] of California. Private activity bonds may only be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public 

[6:2:58,251] benefit, such as the creation of affordable housing. 

[7:0:58,269] The federal government limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual 

[7:1:58,278] basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit is calculated by multiplying 

[7:2:58,287] the state population by $100. The state debt (or tax-exempt bond) limit totaled over $3.92 billion in 2017. The limit for the 

[7:3:58,296] Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $392 

[7:4:58,305] million for 2017. 

[8:0:58,323] The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers 

[8:1:58,332] authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the 

[8:2:58,341] state or of the federal government. 

[9:0:58,359] The Committee administers 10 programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity 

[9:1:58,368] bonds, and is also responsible for the reallocation of Qualified Energy Conservation Bond (QECB) authority originally 

[9:2:58,377] provided to qualified localities, but later waived back to the state. The QECB program, made available through the American 

[9:3:58,386] Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, provides tax incentives and lower borrowing costs for local governments and 

[9:4:58,395] private entities to promote job creation and economic recovery in areas particularly affected by employment decline and to 

[9:5:58,404] facilitate renewable energy conservation programs and projects throughout the state. 

[9:6:58,422] The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer as Chairperson, the Governor, 

[9:7:58,431] or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

[16:0:58,331] 0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 

[17:0:58,349] Specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that support below-market interest 

[17:1:58,358] rates for the specified loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that are used to reduce a homebuyer's federal tax 

[17:2:58,367] liability. Below is a discussion of each program: 

[18:0:58,385] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program: 

[19:0:58,394] These tax-exempt housing revenue bonds assist developers of multifamily rental housing units to acquire land and construct 

[19:1:58,403] new units or purchase and rehabilitate existing units. The tax-exempt bonds lower the interest rate on a mortgage to be paid 

[19:2:58,412] by the developers. The developers, in turn, produce affordable and market rate rental housing for low and very low-income 

[19:3:58,421] households by reducing rental rates to these individuals and families. Projects that receive an award of bond authority have 

[19:4:58,430] the right to apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits. 

[20:0:58,448] Single-Family Housing Program: 

[21:0:58,457] These tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes. Homebuyers may purchase single-

[21:1:58,466] family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income 

[21:2:58,475] limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations. 

[22:0:58,493] Home Improvement and Rehabilitation Bond Program: 

[23:0:58,502] MRBs or MCCs may be used to assist homeowners with home improvement financing. Homeowners may improve single-

[23:1:58,511] family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income 

[23:2:58,520] limits, and in certain cases, must own a home that falls within the program's rehabilitation cost and age-of-home limitations. 

[24:0:58,538] Extra Credit Home Purchase Program: 

[25:0:58,547] These MRBs or MCCs assist teachers, principals and other eligible school staff with purchasing homes. 

[26:0:58,565] Industrial Development Bond Project Program: 

[27:0:58,574] Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds that are issued to assist manufacturing 

[27:1:58,583] facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and midsize manufacturers in 

[27:2:58,592] contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their communities. 

[28:0:58,610] Exempt Facility Program: 

[29:0:58,619] Exempt Facility Bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds that are issued to finance solid waste disposal and waste 

[29:1:58,628] recycling facilities. The tax-exempt bonds provide facility owners with low-cost financing in the form of below-market interest 

[29:2:58,637] rate loans. The interest rate savings enable the project owners to maintain lower customer rates or minimize customer rate 

[29:3:58,646] increases, while at the same time assisting the communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to protect and 

[29:4:58,655] enhance the environment. 

[30:0:58,673] Student Loan Program: 

[31:0:58,682] Student Loan Bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds issued for the purpose of either financing direct loans to college 

[31:1:58,691] students and their parents or purchasing bundles of already-originated loans on the secondary market. When used for direct 

[31:2:58,700] lending programs, tax-exempt bond allocation allows lenders to pass on interest rate savings to financially needy students 

[31:3:58,709] via below-market interest rate loans. 

[32:0:58,727] Beginning Farmer Program: 

[33:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:128,44] 0959 California Debt Limit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] Beginning Farmer Bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds that are issued to back below-market interest rate financing 

[2:1:58,82] for eligible agricultural land, construction/improvements, breeder livestock and equipment for qualified farmers. Eligibility, 

[2:2:58,91] permissible items, and loan limits are set by the United States Internal Revenue Code. Under the program, a conduit bond 

[2:3:58,100] issuer applies to the Committee for an allocation of Beginning Farmer Bonds. If the Committee approves the allocation, the 

[2:4:58,109] issuer then brings together farmers, financial institutions, contract sellers or investors to negotiate terms of a transaction. 

[2:5:58,127] Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program: 

[3:0:58,136] Qualified Public Educational Facility Bonds (QPEF's) are tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the 

[3:1:58,145] construction, renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities. This form of financing reduces the cost of 

[3:2:58,154] financing for schools as interest earned by the lender is tax exempt. 

[3:3:58,172] Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program: 

[4:0:58,181] Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) may be issued as either tax-exempt private activity bonds or governmental 

[4:1:58,190] purpose taxable bonds. When issued as a governmental purpose taxable bond, QECBs provide the issuer with either a 

[4:2:58,199] direct or tax credit interest subsidy. QECBs may be issued to finance a broad array of qualified conservation purposes such 

[4:3:58,208] as capital expenditures, research facilities and research grant programs, mass commuting facilities, public education 

[4:4:58,217] campaigns and demonstration projects.

[10:0:58,335] The Authority was established to assist transportation agencies in obtaining financing to develop transportation projects. To 

[10:1:58,344] meet this objective, statutes allow the Authority to issue, or to approve specified project sponsors to issue, revenue bonds to 

[10:2:58,353] fund transportation projects backed in whole or in part, by various revenue streams of transportation funds (including toll 

[10:3:58,362] revenues). Statutes provide the authority to approve the imposition and collection of tolls on proposed transportation projects 

[10:4:58,371] under certain conditions. The planning, programming, and allocation of transportation projects are performed by the 

[10:5:58,380] California Transportation Commission and the California Department of Transportation, as appropriate. 

[11:0:95,422] 0965 California Industrial Development Financing Advisory Commission 

[11:1:58,443] The California Industrial Development Financing Advisory Commission creates employment opportunities and supports local 

[11:2:58,452] economic development by approving local entities' issuance of industrial development bonds. These bonds provide 

[11:3:58,461] manufacturers with a low-cost financing option to build, expand, or equip their facilities in California. The Commission 

[11:4:58,470] independently reviews bond applications to ensure compliance with federal tax law and state law, provides technical 

[11:5:58,479] assistance to bond issuers, and approves the bond sales by local authorities. 

[12:0:58,497] The State Treasurer serves as chairperson of the Commission. The other members are the Director of the Department of 

[12:1:58,506] Finance, the State Controller, the Director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, and the

[12:0:58,329] The core program area is the Industrial Development Bond Program, under which the Commission serves as the mandatory 

[12:1:58,338] approval agency for the local bond issuers. Once potential borrowers (manufacturers and processing companies) apply 

[12:2:58,347] through their local government agency for low cost tax-exempt financing, the Commission carefully reviews the public 

[12:3:58,356] benefits generated by the proposed project, particularly those benefits associated with job creation, and determines whether 

[12:4:58,365] these benefits will significantly outweigh any detrimental public effects. Eligible capital expenditures include the acquisition 

[12:5:58,374] of land, building construction, building renovation, and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Bond proceeds also can 

[12:6:58,383] be used to cover the cost of architects, engineers, attorneys, permits, and the cost of bond issuance. The local issuer can 

[12:7:58,392] be a city, county, economic development authority, or a joint power authority.

[0:0:58,15] 2017-18 STATE BUDGET — LJE 232   LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[1:0:128,44] 0968 California Tax Credit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[2:0:58,95] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,123] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 

[3:1:58,141] The Federal Low-Income Housing Tax-Credit Program: 

[4:0:58,159] Congress authorized the federal program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax incentives, such as accelerated 

[4:1:58,168] depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise project equity through the "sale" 

[4:2:58,177] of tax benefits to investors. 

[5:0:58,195] The annual housing credit ceiling is indexed for inflation. As of 2016, each state has an annual housing credit ceiling of 

[5:1:58,204] $2.35 per state resident, and may qualify for a share of credits available annually in a national pool comprised of states' 

[5:2:58,213] unused credits. Investors can take the annual credit against their federal income tax liability each year for a ten-year period. 

[5:3:58,231] The State Low-Income Housing Tax-Credit Program: 

[6:0:58,249] Recognizing the high cost of developing housing in California, the California Legislature authorized the State Low-Income 

[6:1:58,258] Housing Tax-Credit Program to augment the federal tax credit program. Specifically, projects that are not receiving an 

[6:2:58,267] increase in their federal tax credit basis may apply for and receive state tax credits. However, an exception to this rule is in 

[6:3:58,276] place for projects serving special needs populations (as defined in Section 10325 of the California Code of Regulations). 

[6:4:58,285] Those projects may apply for and receive state tax credits even if they are receiving an increase in their federal tax credit 

[6:5:58,294] basis. The project's "eligible basis" is the portion of the total project cost that is used to calculate the amount of the tax credit. 

[6:6:58,312] The annual state credit ceiling is currently $94.5 million, indexed for inflation. Investors take the state credit over a four-year 

[6:7:58,321] period in contrast to the ten-year federal allocation period. 

[6:8:58,339] Tax-Exempt Bond Financed Program: 

[7:0:58,357] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may also receive federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects 

[7:1:58,366] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but 

[7:2:58,375] there is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. The annual credit 

[7:3:58,384] available is based on approximately four percent of the qualified basis of the development. The qualified basis includes 

[7:4:58,393] those costs attributable to the units that will be income and rent restricted for a minimum of 30 years. 

[7:5:58,411] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years; however, California's program generally 

[7:6:58,420] requires maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure 

[7:7:58,429] compliance. 

[8:0:58,447] Farmworker Housing Tax-Credit Program: 

[9:0:58,465] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008 folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance tax credits into the general state low-

[9:1:58,474] income housing tax-credit program. While $500,000 annually continues to be authorized for state tax credits in support of 

[9:2:58,483] farmworker housing, the program now operates under the rules of the general state low-income housing tax-credit program.

[11:0:58,574] 0971 California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority 

[11:1:58,594] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, 

[11:2:58,603] Statutes of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more 

[11:3:58,612] efficiently utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future 

[11:4:58,621] to protect the environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse 

[11:5:58,630] gas emissions by providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable 

[11:6:58,639] energy sources, implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment 

[11:7:58,648] opportunities, and lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing 

[11:8:58,657] and credit enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and 

[11:9:58,666] facilities needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 

[11:10:58,684] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the 

[11:11:58,693] Director of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development 

[11:12:58,702] Commission, and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[1:0:58,44] 0971 California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority 

[1:1:272,62] - Continued 

[2:0:58,100] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,127] 0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 

[4:0:58,145] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the 

[4:1:58,154] authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements or liquidity facilities, contributions of money, or a 

[4:2:58,163] combination thereof, as determined and approved by resolution of the Authority. 

[5:0:58,181] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative 

[5:1:58,190] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012, 

[5:2:58,199] expanded the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE 

[5:3:58,208] awards. Chapter 768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process 

[5:4:58,217] recycled feedstock and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. The 

[5:5:58,226] objective of this program is to promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed 

[5:6:58,235] at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy consumption. 

[6:0:58,253] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 

[6:1:58,262] 2013 (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority 

[6:2:58,271] developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for 

[6:3:58,280] residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for 

[6:4:58,289] residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. 

[7:0:58,307] Most recently, the Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on 

[7:1:58,316] behalf of, and in collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot 

[7:2:58,325] programs will employ various types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the 

[7:3:58,334] residential and commercial sectors) for energy efficiency improvements needed to help achieve California's energy efficiency 

[7:4:58,343] goals.

[16:0:58,281] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[17:0:58,309] 0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM 

[18:0:58,327] The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the 

[18:1:58,336] acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment, 

[18:2:58,345] waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority 

[18:3:58,354] assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 

[18:4:58,363] 1989. As of June 30, 2016, bonds totaling approximately $14.8 billion have been issued by the Authority. 

[19:0:58,381] 0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 

[20:0:58,399] The objective of this program is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. 

[20:1:58,408] CalCAP for Small Businesses is a form of loan portfolio insurance that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain 

[20:2:58,417] loan defaults. By participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the 

[20:3:58,426] financing needs of California's small businesses. The strength of CalCAP rests in its simplicity and its leverage of federal 

[20:4:58,435] and state funds. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating financial 

[20:5:58,444] institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional incentives are 

[20:6:58,453] provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk, allowing banks 

[20:7:58,462] to lend to targeted California small businesses. Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General Fund to 

[20:8:58,471] CalCAP to increase lending efforts. As of June 30, 2016, approximately $3.5 million of the $6 million has been used to assist 

[20:9:58,480] small businesses. 

[21:0:58,498] In addition, California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168.6 million from the federal State 

[21:1:58,507] Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The Authority and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development 

[21:2:58,516] (Go-BIZ) equally share this allocation of $84.3 million each. These funds have enabled the Authority to significantly expand 

[21:3:58,525] the availability of its CalCAP program statewide. The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to assist more 

[21:4:58,534] small businesses and utilize the SSBCI Federal funds. Funds were allocated to California in three installments based on 

[21:5:58,543] program progress. The Authority received $27 million in March 2011, $27 million in December 2013, and $29 million in 

[21:6:58,552] August 2015. 

[22:0:58,570] Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck and 

[22:1:58,579] equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $95 million in Air Quality Improvement 

[22:2:58,588] Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The 

[22:3:58,597] Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit 

[22:4:58,606] enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations. Similarly, the Authority 

[22:5:58,615] is partnering with the Department of Resources, Recycling, and Recovery to assist with the financing of important state 

[22:6:58,624] recycling objectives. 

[23:0:58,642] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 

[24:0:58,660] The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived 

[24:1:58,669] contamination issues (brownfields). CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of brownfields 

[24:2:58,678] to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided 

[24:3:58,687] forgivable loans of up to $300,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and 

[24:4:58,696] characterization, technical assistance, remedial action plans and site access. Eligible projects included sites with potential 

[24:5:58,705] beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty 

[24:6:58,714] about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process. 

[25:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:114,44] 0974 California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund 

[2:1:58,82] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of CALReUSE. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received $60 

[2:2:58,91] million in Proposition 1C funds and is providing up to $5 million per project in loans and grants for the purpose of brownfield 

[2:3:58,100] cleanup that promotes infill residential and mixed-used development, including affordable housing, consistent with regional 

[2:4:58,109] and local land use plans. 

[3:0:58,127] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 

[4:0:58,145] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and 

[4:1:58,154] alternative energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with 

[4:2:58,163] achieving the state's environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources 

[4:3:58,172] including federal and state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 

[5:0:58,190] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES 

[5:1:58,199] ACT 

[6:0:58,217] The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal 

[6:1:58,226] Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other 

[6:2:58,235] financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the 

[6:3:58,244] Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the 

[6:4:58,253] CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program. 

[6:5:58,271] 0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM 

[7:0:58,289] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a 

[7:1:58,298] one-time allocation of $10 million to provide an accessible loan program to qualified small businesses and residential 

[7:2:58,307] property owners (including multiunit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of Housing and 

[7:3:58,316] Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other financial 

[7:4:58,325] institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program. The 

[7:5:58,334] loans to small businesses and residential property owners are for financing seismic retrofits of real property to reduce losses 

[7:6:58,343] and mitigate seismic damage.

[5:0:58,167] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 

[6:0:58,185] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (the 

[6:1:58,194] ABLE Act), which allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings 

[6:2:58,203] accounts. Individuals can make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a specified beneficiary 

[6:3:58,212] with tax-free earnings. ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are 

[6:4:58,221] used for qualified services. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the 

[6:5:58,230] State Treasurer to administer ABLE accounts on behalf of qualified Californians. 

[6:6:58,248] The California Achieving a Better Life Experience Act Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by 

[6:7:58,257] Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the purpose of creating a statewide program known as the Qualified ABLE 

[6:8:58,266] Program (the Program). Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $100,000 for a taxable year, for the 

[6:9:58,275] benefit of an individual who is an eligible individual for that taxable year, to an ABLE account that is established for the 

[6:10:58,284] purpose of meeting the qualified expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account.

[18:3:58,579] Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, and 2006, for a total of $900 million. 

[18:4:58,588] Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, extends the existing CSFP and authorized a total of $500 million in 

[18:5:58,597] State General Obligation Bonds for charter school construction projects. 

[19:0:58,615] The program provides a 50 percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project 

[19:1:58,624] costs being repaid (to the state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must 

[19:2:58,633] provide site-based instruction, be deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements. 

[19:3:58,651] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 

[20:0:58,669] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded a grant under the United States Department of Education's State Charter 

[20:1:58,678] School Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for 

[20:2:58,687] facilities costs. Grant funds are used toward a charter school's cost of rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for 

[20:3:58,696] existing or new facilities or toward the costs of acquiring land and constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to 

[20:4:58,705] charter schools based on preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage overcrowded, 

[20:5:58,714] not-for-profit status, and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding.

[12:0:58,404] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[13:0:58,431] 0940 - BOND FINANCING 

[14:0:58,449] CEFA issues revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning construct educational facilities. 

[14:1:58,458] Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, the Authority may be able to provide more favorable financing terms 

[14:2:58,467] than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for 

[14:3:58,476] the construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and 

[14:4:58,485] credit or the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the 

[14:5:58,494] participating institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the 

[14:6:58,503] state's "private activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law. 

[15:0:58,521] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private 

[15:1:58,530] college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on his or her race or ethnicity, provided that the financing 

[15:2:58,539] does not violate constitutional provisions. 

[16:0:58,557] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA 

[16:1:58,566] to issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings 

[16:2:58,575] than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 

[16:3:58,593] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 

[17:0:58,611] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the 

[17:1:58,620] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 

[17:2:58,629] 2015, added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after 

[17:3:58,638] January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018.
