[1:0:226,44] 3900 Air Resources Board 

[1:1:58,64] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 

[1:2:58,73] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 

[1:3:58,82] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 

[1:4:58,91] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These 

[1:5:58,100] plans include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board 

[1:6:58,109] and local air pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the 

[1:7:58,118] Secretary for Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 

[1:8:58,127] and at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, 

[1:9:58,136] Statutes of 2016 (SB 32). 

[2:0:58,154] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 

[2:1:58,163] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[7:0:58,336] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:0:58,363] 3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND BROWNFIELDS REUSE 

[9:0:58,381] The Site Mitigation and Brownfields Reuse program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal 

[9:1:58,390] Superfund program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,170 hazardous substance release site investigations 

[9:2:58,399] and cleanups, and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 470 sites where the cleanup 

[9:3:58,408] process is complete. Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 820 

[9:4:58,417] land-use restrictions in place on properties throughout the state. 

[10:0:58,435] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other 

[10:1:58,444] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to 

[10:2:58,453] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund 

[10:3:58,462] properties, abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and 

[10:4:58,471] closed military installations. 

[11:0:58,489] The program oversees environmental assessments and the clean-up of proposed new or expanding school sites to prevent 

[11:1:58,498] or reduce exposing students and staff to hazardous substances. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow 

[11:2:58,507] Hazardous Waste Site, a former hazardous waste disposal site and federal Superfund Site. 

[12:0:58,525] The program works closely with other state agencies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local 

[12:1:58,534] agencies throughout the state to establish and implement viable grant and loan programs to aid in the assessment and 

[12:2:58,543] clean-up of brownfields sites. 

[13:0:58,561] The program works with the California Emergency Management Agency and other state agencies to assure response 

[13:1:58,570] readiness for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway 

[13:2:58,579] hazardous waste spills and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories. 

[14:0:58,597] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 

[15:0:58,615] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of 

[15:1:58,624] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance 

[15:2:58,633] at 119 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous 

[15:3:58,642] waste, and approximately 300 facilities/generators that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages 

[15:4:58,651] approximately $2.2 billion in financial assurance resources, and supports and oversees local agencies implementing the 

[15:5:58,660] hazardous waste elements of the Unified Program. 

[16:0:58,678] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including 

[16:1:58,687] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous 

[16:2:58,696] waste requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other 

[16:3:58,705] focused enforcement initiatives. The program also ensures compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to 

[16:4:58,714] electronic waste and used oil.

[2:0:58,73] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 

[3:0:58,91] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program strives to get manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to 

[3:1:58,100] toxic chemicals. SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products and use pollution prevention best practices. The 

[3:2:58,109] program implements the SCP regulations. SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in 

[3:3:58,118] order to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers 

[3:4:58,127] for the analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages 

[3:5:58,136] the adoption of "green chemistry" practices. 

[4:0:58,154] Pollution Prevention responsibilities are to promote compliance with legislative mandates regarding consumer product 

[4:1:58,163] chemical safety. The program supports adoption of focused business sector pollution prevention strategies; supports local 

[4:2:58,172] green business initiatives; and helps the regulated community comply with laws and regulations.  

[5:0:58,190] This program, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard 

[5:1:58,199] Assessment, also implements the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program. DTSC's Environmental 

[5:2:58,208] Chemistry Laboratory (ECL) is charged with measuring both targeted and new chemicals in blood and urine. Ongoing 

[5:3:58,217] activities include measuring these chemicals in studies of vulnerable populations, including mothers and their newborns, 

[5:4:58,226] older women, firefighters, and families with childhood leukemia. Additionally, ECL is continuously developing new methods 

[5:5:58,235] to identify and measure chemicals of emerging concern, including newer flame retardants and other substitutes and 

[5:6:58,244] alternatives for restricted/banned toxic chemicals. The SCP program will rely on biomonitoring results for implementation of 

[5:7:58,253] its three-year Priority Products Work Plan. Biomonitoring evidence has been called out in the Work Plan as a priority 

[5:8:58,262] screening tool for identification of product-chemical combinations warranting consideration of safer alternatives. 

[5:9:58,280] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY 

[6:0:58,298] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department of Toxic Substances Control as the Certified 

[6:1:58,307] Unified Program Agency (CUPA) in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the Department is responsible for 

[6:2:58,316] implementing the six elements of the Unified Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-

[6:3:58,325] prevention control and countermeasure plans for owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; underground storage 

[6:4:58,334] tank program; hazardous material release response plans and inventories; California Accidental Release Prevention 

[6:5:58,343] program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories. 

[6:6:58,361] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEAN UP PROGRAM  

[7:0:58,379] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Clean Up Program oversees the removal and remedial actions in the 

[7:1:58,388] communities surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the 

[7:2:58,397] program, DTSC will test the soil for lead contamination in approximately 10,000 properties, including residences, schools, 

[7:3:58,406] daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7 mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated soil at those 

[7:4:58,415] properties with the highest levels and greatest potential for exposure. 

[7:5:58,433] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION 

[8:0:58,451] The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce 

[8:1:58,460] management, data processing, performance management, business services, and other administrative support to 

[9:0:58,469] departmental programs. Administration also supports operations in Sacramento, Clovis, Berkeley, Chatsworth, Cypress, San 

[9:1:58,478] Diego, and El Centro, including two environmental chemistry laboratories located in northern and southern California.

[1:0:139,44] 3980 Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment 

[1:1:58,64] The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances public health and the environment through 

[1:2:58,73] objective scientific evaluation of risks posed by hazardous substances. The Office performs risk assessments for various 

[1:3:58,82] regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other state and local agencies, and 

[1:4:58,91] provides these programs with the scientific tools and information upon which to base risk management decisions. Distinct 

[1:5:58,100] programs focus on assessing health risks, including risks to children and other sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to 

[1:6:58,109] chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, hazardous and municipal waste facilities, fish and 

[1:7:58,118] shellfish, and sediments in bay and estuarine waters. The Office also evaluates community pollution burdens and 

[1:8:58,127] vulnerabilities.
