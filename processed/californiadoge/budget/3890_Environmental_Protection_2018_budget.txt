[1:0:227,43] 3900   Air Resources Board 

[2:0:66,64] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 

[3:0:66,74] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 

[3:1:66,84] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 

[4:0:66,95] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 

[4:1:66,105] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air 

[4:2:66,115] pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for 

[5:0:66,125] Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40 

[6:0:66,135] percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 

[6:1:66,146] 32). 

[7:0:66,166] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 

[7:1:66,176] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:136,38] 3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] †   Fiscal year 2016-17 budget information reflects the latest available estimates for this department and/or fund(s). Changes 

[3:1:66,79] resulting from the final reconciliation of the 2016-17 ending fund balance will be reflected as a prior year adjustment in the 

[3:2:66,89] 2019-20 Governor’s Budget publication. 

[4:0:66,116] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[5:0:66,134] 3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND BROWNFIELDS REUSE 

[6:0:66,152] The Site Mitigation and Brownfields Reuse program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal 

[6:1:66,162] Superfund program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,170 hazardous substance release site investigations and 

[6:2:66,172] cleanups, and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 470 sites where the cleanup process is 

[6:3:66,182] complete. Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 820 land-use 

[6:4:66,193] restrictions in place on properties throughout the state. 

[7:0:66,210] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other 

[7:1:66,220] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to 

[7:2:66,231] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties, 

[7:3:66,241] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military 

[7:4:66,251] installations. 

[8:0:66,269] The program oversees environmental assessments and the clean-up of proposed new or expanding school sites to prevent or 

[8:1:66,279] reduce exposing students and staff to hazardous substances. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous 

[8:2:66,289] Waste Site, a former hazardous waste disposal site and federal Superfund Site. 

[9:0:66,307] The program works closely with other state agencies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local agencies 

[9:1:66,317] throughout the state to establish and implement viable grant and loan programs to aid in the assessment and clean-up of 

[9:2:66,327] brownfields sites. 

[10:0:66,345] The program works with the California Emergency Management Agency and other state agencies to assure response 

[10:1:66,355] readiness for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous 

[10:2:66,365] waste spills and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories. 

[11:0:66,383] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 

[12:0:66,401] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of 

[12:1:66,411] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at 

[12:2:66,421] 119 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous 

[12:3:66,431] waste, and approximately 300 facilities/generators that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages 

[12:4:66,442] approximately $2.2 billion in financial assurance resources, and supports and oversees local agencies implementing the 

[12:5:66,452] hazardous waste elements of the Unified Program. 

[13:0:66,469] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including 

[13:1:66,480] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste 

[13:2:66,490] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused 

[13:3:66,500] enforcement initiatives. The program also ensures compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste 

[13:4:66,510] and used oil. 

[14:0:66,528] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 

[15:0:66,546] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program strives to get manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to 

[15:1:66,556] toxic chemicals. SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products and use pollution prevention best practices. The 

[15:2:66,566] program implements the SCP regulations. SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order 

[15:3:66,576] to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the 

[15:4:66,586] analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption 

[15:5:66,597] of "green chemistry" practices. 

[16:0:66,614] Pollution Prevention responsibilities are to promote compliance with legislative mandates regarding consumer product chemical 

[16:1:66,625] safety. The program supports adoption of focused business sector pollution prevention strategies; supports local green 

[16:2:66,635] business initiatives; and helps the regulated community comply with laws and regulations. 

[17:0:66,652] This program, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, 

[17:1:66,663] also implements the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program. The Department's Environmental 

[17:2:66,673] Chemistry Laboratory (ECL) is charged with measuring both targeted and new chemicals in blood and urine. Ongoing activities 

[17:3:66,683] include measuring these chemicals in studies of vulnerable populations, including mothers and their newborns, older women, 

[17:4:66,693] firefighters, and families with childhood leukemia. Additionally, ECL is continuously developing new methods to identify and 

[17:5:66,703] measure chemicals of emerging concern, including newer flame retardants and other substitutes and alternatives for restricted/ 

[17:6:66,714] banned toxic chemicals. The SCP program will rely on biomonitoring results for implementation of its three-year Priority 

[18:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,65] Products Work Plan. Biomonitoring evidence has been identified in the Work Plan as a priority screening tool for identification 

[3:1:66,75] of product-chemical combinations warranting consideration of safer alternatives. 

[3:2:66,93] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY 

[4:0:66,110] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) 

[4:1:66,121] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the Department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified 

[4:2:66,131] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for 

[4:3:66,141] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response 

[4:4:66,151] plans and inventories; California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements 

[4:5:66,161] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories. 

[5:0:66,179] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEAN UP PROGRAM 

[6:0:66,197] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Clean Up Program oversees the removal and remedial actions in the 

[6:1:66,207] communities surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program, 

[6:2:66,217] the Department will test the soil for lead contamination in approximately 10,000 properties, including residences, schools, 

[6:3:66,227] daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7 mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated soil at those 

[6:4:66,238] properties with the highest levels and greatest potential for exposure. 

[6:5:66,255] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION 

[7:0:66,273] The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management, 

[7:1:66,283] information management, and business services. The program also provides legal counsel, external communication, analytical 

[7:2:66,293] chemistry support, environmental justice and tribal affairs consultation, and public participation services.

[6:1:66,297] Environment develops and implements a unified education strategy for educating pupils, faculty, and administrators on the 

[6:2:66,307] importance of integrating environmental concepts and programs for elementary and secondary schools. The EEI vision 

[6:3:66,317] encourages responsible stewardship of the Earth, advances tomorrow's leaders in a changing economy, and positively impacts 

[6:4:66,328] the lives of students, families, schools, communities, and California. 

[6:5:66,345] 3715 - Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction 

[7:0:66,363] CalRecycle administers the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction program with a goal of achieving an 80-percent 

[7:1:66,373] recycling rate for glass, aluminum, and plastic beverage containers sold in California. To achieve this goal, the Division of 

[7:2:66,383] Recycling ensures the following: (1) the California Redemption Value (CRV) is paid by beverage distributors for each beverage 

[7:3:66,394] sold in California; (2) consumers are refunded CRV for recycled beverage containers; (3) recycling centers are conveniently 

[7:4:66,404] located; (4) grants are made to encourage recycling and development of markets for recycled materials; (5) strong oversight 

[7:5:66,414] and enforcement programs are in place to protect the integrity of the Beverage Container Recycling Fund; and (6) public 

[7:6:66,424] outreach and private partnerships are promoted.
