[2:0:107,32] 4140   Department of Health Care Access and Information - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Hospital Fair Billing Program receives and investigates consumer complaints regarding hospital billing and enforces the  

[3:1:66,78] hospital fair pricing policies. The Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) has three primary responsibilities: managing cost  

[3:2:66,88] growth targets, monitoring system performance, and assessing market consolidation. OHCA will collect, analyze, and publicly  

[3:3:66,98] report data on total health care expenditures, and enforce cost growth targets set by a new Health Care Affordability Board. To  

[3:4:66,108] ensure a balanced approach to managing costs, OHCA will monitor system performance by measuring quality, equity, adoption  

[3:5:66,117] of alternative payment models, investment in primary care and behavioral health, and workforce stability. Through cost and  

[3:6:66,127] market impact reviews, OHCA will analyze transactions that are likely to significantly impact on market competition, the state’s  

[3:7:66,137] ability to meet cost targets, or affordability for consumers and purchasers. Based on results of the review, OHCA will then  

[3:8:66,147] coordinate with other state agencies to address consolidation as appropriate.  

[3:9:66,164] 3835 - HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE  

[4:0:66,183] The Health Care Workforce Program improves access to medical, mental, and dental health care providers in underserved  

[4:1:66,193] areas throughout California. The Program conducts research to identify areas of unmet need and administers grants that  

[4:2:66,203] provide financial incentives to individuals and institutions to increase the number of providers in those areas. The Program  

[4:3:66,213] promotes health care workforce diversity and cultural competency. It includes the following programs:  

[4:4:65,230] • Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Program  

[5:0:65,246] • Mental Health Services Act Workforce Education and Training Program  

[5:1:65,262] • Health Professions Careers Opportunity Program  

[5:2:65,277] • Health Workforce Pilot Projects Program  

[5:3:65,293] • Health Workforce Research Data Center  

[6:0:65,309] • California Primary Care Office which includes the Shortage Designation Program  

[6:1:65,325] • California State Office of Rural Health includes:  

[6:2:74,342] • The J-1 Visa Waiver Program  

[6:3:74,358] • Small Hospital Improvement Program  

[7:0:74,374] • Medicare Critical Access Hospital Flexibility Program  

[7:1:65,397] • California Health Workforce Education and Training Council  

[7:2:65,413] • Scholarship Programs  

[8:0:65,428] • Loan Repayment Programs, including the California State Loan Repayment Program, Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps  

[8:1:76,438] Loan Repayment Program and Licensed Mental Health Services Provider Education Program  

[8:2:65,454] • Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Workforce Programs  

[8:3:66,471] 3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT  

[9:0:66,488] The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and  

[9:1:66,498] construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of  

[9:2:66,508] providing sustained services to the public.  

[9:3:66,525] 3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE  

[10:0:66,545] The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and  

[10:1:66,555] nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors  

[10:2:66,564] the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating  

[10:3:66,574] access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California.  

[10:4:66,591] The Distressed Hospital Loan Program requires HCAI and the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (CHFFA) to  

[10:5:66,601] collaboratively administer the Distressed Hospital Loan Program to offer interest-free, working capital loans to non-profit and  

[10:6:66,611] publicly-operated financially distressed hospitals, including hospitals that belong to integrated health care systems with no more  

[10:7:66,621] than two separately licensed hospitals in California that are facing a risk of closure, while they implement turnaround strategies  

[10:8:66,631] to regain financial viability.   HCAI contracts with CHFFA through an Inter-Agency Agreement to administer the loan program. 

[10:9:66,640] The founding legislation also includes provisions requiring hospitals to submit quarterly financial data to HCAI, for use in  

[10:10:66,650] monitoring the financial health of hospitals throughout the state.  

[10:11:66,667] 3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 

[11:0:66,685] The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from  

[11:1:66,694] approximately 9,500 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment  

[11:2:66,704] data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory  

[11:3:66,714] surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers,

[7:0:66,418] The Department of Aging's mission is to transform aging for individuals, families, and communities by leading innovative  

[8:0:66,428] programs, planning, policies, and partnerships that increase choices, equity, and well-being for all Californians as we age. The  

[8:1:66,437] population served includes older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers.  

[9:0:66,455] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the California Department of Aging (CDA) administers federal Older  

[10:0:66,464] Americans Act programs that provide a wide variety of home and community-based supportive services through contracts with  

[10:1:66,474] a statewide network of 33 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and the 11 statewide Caregiver Resource Centers (CRCs). The  

[11:0:66,484] Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs; it contracts directly with agencies that operate 37 Multipurpose Senior  

[11:1:66,494] Services Program (MSSP) sites and certifies 289 Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS) centers for participation in Medi-

[11:2:66,504] Cal.   In addition, the Department oversees implementation of the Governor’s Master Plan for Aging and California’s efforts to  

[12:0:66,513] build a No Wrong Door system centered in the development of the Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) program  

[12:1:66,523] to provide person centered counseling and support to older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers. CDA  

[13:0:66,533] administers the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP) that provides individualized counseling to  

[14:0:66,543] Medicare beneficiaries, and houses the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program with oversight for the rights of residents in

[2:0:141,32] 4300   Department of Developmental Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Department of Developmental Services (Department) is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities  

[3:1:66,78] Services Act for overseeing the coordination and delivery of services and supports that persons with developmental disabilities  

[3:2:66,88] need to lead more independent and productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets  

[3:3:66,98] broad policy and provides leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities and standards within which  

[3:4:66,108] the developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate  

[3:5:66,117] problems that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community  

[3:6:66,127] agencies known as regional centers as well as through state-operated programs. The Department, through contracts with the  

[3:7:66,137] 21 regional centers, oversees through audits and other review the coordination of services to persons with developmental  

[3:8:66,147] disabilities; provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each  

[3:9:66,156] stage of their lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community.  

[3:10:66,174] Because the Department’s programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[3:11:66,183] support this need. For specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:141,32] 4300   Department of Developmental Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,87] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,106] 4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,126] Through the network of regional centers, the Department contracts with regional centers to support the development and  

[5:1:66,136] maintenance of services for eligible persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers  

[5:2:66,145] directly provide or coordinate the following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis,  

[5:3:66,155] (3) counseling, (4) lifelong individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the  

[5:4:66,165] individual program plan, (6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of  

[5:5:66,175] legal, civil, and service rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning,  

[5:6:66,184] placement, and monitoring for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families,  

[5:7:66,194] (12) community education about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services.  

[6:0:66,211] 4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,229] The Department currently operates two larger residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County), which is in  

[7:1:66,239] warm shutdown, and Porterville Developmental Center (Tulare County). Secure treatment services are provided at the  

[7:2:66,248] Porterville Developmental Center for   individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial due to their developmental  

[7:3:66,258] disability or are dangerous to themselves or others and civilly committed to the facility by court order. The Department also  

[7:4:66,268] operates Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences in Northern, Central, and Southern  

[8:0:66,278] California   to provide acute crisis services in the community. Finally, the Department leases one community facility for persons  

[8:1:66,287] who require specialized behavioral interventions and acute crisis stabilization: Canyon Springs in Cathedral City (Riverside  

[8:2:66,297] County). Under the California Department of Public Health, Porterville Developmental Center is licensed as a General Acute  

[8:3:66,307] Care Hospital and Intermediate Care Facility, and Canyon Springs Community Facility operates as an Intermediate Care  

[8:4:66,317] Facility.  

[9:0:66,334] STAR residences operate as community crisis homes. Services involve the provision of active treatment through residential  

[9:1:66,344] and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and  

[9:2:66,354] assistance with activities of daily living, training, education, and employment.  

[10:0:66,371] Individuals served in the STAR crisis   residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and  

[10:1:66,381] habilitation services during a crisis and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their home  

[10:2:66,390] or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program   is to provide a safety net of services that include  

[10:3:66,400] providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed need and as outlined in  

[10:4:66,410] each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner  

[10:5:66,420] to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system and are designed to teach individuals the skills for  

[10:6:66,429] increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance personal competence in  

[10:7:66,439] all areas of daily living.  

[11:0:66,457] 4149 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION  

[12:0:66,476] The objective of this program is to: (1) provide overall management, planning and policy development, legal, legislative, audit,  

[12:1:66,486] and administrative services; (2) manage revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state programs, insurance  

[12:2:66,496] companies, and private payers; (3) monitor regional center operations for compliance with statute, regulations, and their  

[12:3:66,505] contract with the Department; (4) provide central administrative and clinical management services to the   state-operated  

[12:4:66,515] programs to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with state licensing and federal certification requirements,  

[12:5:66,525] protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility structures and grounds; and (5) oversee areas that include the  

[12:6:66,535] development of policies and procedures for developmental center operations, law enforcement and protective services,  

[12:7:66,544] population management, program and fiscal oversight, and facility planning and support.

[5:0:66,153] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[6:0:66,172] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of facilities under its control,  

[6:1:66,181] including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities  

[6:2:66,191] are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County.  

[6:3:66,208] The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet on 784 acres. As of February 2020,  

[6:4:66,218] the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former residents to community  

[6:5:66,228] living. The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until disposition of the property.  

[6:6:66,238] The Department is projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences that  

[6:7:66,247] provide acute crisis services in the community. Additionally, the Department is responsible for the maintenance of interior  

[6:8:66,257] finishes and equipment at Canyon Springs, a 57,000-square-foot leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities support the  

[6:9:66,267] Department's mission in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; and vocational  

[6:10:66,277] training for residents with developmental disabilities committed to a state-operated facility.

[13:0:201,632] 4440   Department of State Hospitals  

[14:0:66,653] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is  

[14:1:66,662] to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, by leading innovation and excellence across a  

[14:2:66,672] continuum of care and settings. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health treatment of its  

[14:3:66,682] patients. The Department oversees five state hospitals located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and  

[14:4:66,692] Patton,   and employs over 13,000 staff. In addition to the state hospital treatment,   the Department provides services in  

[14:5:66,701] contracted jail-based competency treatment (JBCT), community-based restoration (CBR), community inpatient facilities and  

[14:6:66,711] pre-trial felony mental health diversion programs, and the conditional release program (CONREP).

[2:0:170,32] 5160   Department of Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES  

[5:0:66,101] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities through  

[5:1:66,111] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that individuals with  

[5:2:66,121] disabilities may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In  

[5:3:66,130] addition, the Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education,  

[5:4:66,140] behavioral/mental health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of  

[5:5:66,150] Selection process, which gives priority to individuals with the most significant disabilities.  

[6:0:66,167] Individuals with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range  

[6:1:66,177] of services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement,  

[6:2:66,187] supported employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their  

[6:3:66,196] communities. The Department provides Work Incentives Planning services to reduce dependency on public benefits. The  

[6:4:66,206] Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals working in non-

[6:5:66,216] competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment.  

[7:0:66,233] The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and  

[7:1:66,243] auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16 up to  

[7:2:66,253] 22 (depending on their exit from their special education program), including many who may benefit from early career  

[7:3:66,263] development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary  

[7:4:66,272] education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy. 

[8:0:66,290] The Department, through its Business Enterprises Program, provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to  

[8:1:66,299] enable individuals who are blind or visually impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and  

[8:2:66,309] cafeterias. Prevocational, including employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to  

[8:3:66,319] consumers with vision loss to prepare them for independent living.  

[9:0:66,336] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation  

[9:1:66,346] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and  

[9:2:66,356] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.  

[10:0:66,373] The   Department administers the Pathways to Success Project (PSP) to increase competitive integrated employment outcomes,  

[10:1:66,383] economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion, through a unique service delivery design supported by sector-specific  

[10:2:66,393] teams specializing in high-wage, high-skill, and high-demand careers for individuals with disabilities. The PSP, which is a pilot  

[10:3:66,402] research project, is particularly targeted at underrepresented communities, including people of color, women, and individuals  

[10:4:66,412] with intellectual or developmental disabilities. 

[11:0:66,429] The Department administers the California Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment Project (CSP) to provide  

[11:1:66,439] a comprehensive set of interventions and supports to increase competitive integrated employment outcomes, independence,  

[11:2:66,449] economic self-sufficiency, and inclusion for individuals with the most significant disabilities currently in, or contemplating  

[11:3:66,459] entering, subminimum wage employment. The CSP, which is a pilot research project, will establish evidence-based approaches  

[11:4:66,469] to vocational rehabilitation service delivery that will improve the employment outcomes of its participants, transitioning more  

[11:5:66,478] workers with disabilities into competitive integrated employment. 

[12:0:66,496] The Department administers the Integrated Employment in Recovery program (IER) to provide training to the provider  

[12:1:66,505] workforce on evidence-based practices to serve people with substance use disorders (SUD) related to opioid use that can be  

[12:2:66,515] incorporated as a part of holistic recovery. The training focuses on incorporating the full range of vocational rehabilitation  

[12:3:66,525] services into treatment delivery as part of a whole-person approach to recovery and developing supports for individuals  

[12:4:66,535] returning to or transitioning into work during and following treatment. 

[13:0:66,552] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES  

[14:0:66,569] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout  

[14:1:66,579] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently   with full  

[14:2:66,589] inclusion   in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems  

[14:3:66,599] change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion  

[14:4:66,608] services to community-based living, and   transition services to postsecondary life for youth.  

[15:0:66,626] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their  

[15:1:66,635] families, six service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for individuals with  

[15:2:66,645] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for  

[15:3:66,655] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to  

[15:4:66,665] administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a  

[15:5:66,675] TBI state plan, sustainability plan, statewide TBI registry, and needs assessment.  

[16:0:66,692] In addition, the Department expands the capacity of existing TBI sites and stands up new TBI sites in alignment with Home and  

[16:1:66,702] Community-Based Services surrounding transition and diversion through community reintegration, personal care services  

[16:2:66,711] through supported living services, and other supportive services to improve functional capabilities of individuals with TBI.

[3:0:66,68] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 16 non-profit community-based  

[3:1:66,78] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually  

[3:2:66,88] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low  

[3:3:66,98] vision evaluations/screenings, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills,  

[3:4:66,108] independent living skills training, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.  

[3:5:66,125] Through a partnership with the California Public Utilities Commission’s Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, the  

[3:6:66,135] Department’s Voice Options program provides eligible Californians who are unable to speak, or who have difficulty speaking,  

[3:7:66,144] with a free speech-generating device. The goal of this program is to ensure full and equal telephone communications access  

[3:8:66,154] for all Californians with disabilities.  

[4:0:66,171] The Department administers the Community Living Fund program that provides   transition or diversion services to individuals to  

[4:1:66,181] support community-based living which enables older adults and people with disabilities to access funding to move from an  

[4:2:66,191] institutional setting to the community or to support individuals who are at risk of going into an institution to remain in their  

[4:3:66,201] community.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,101] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing  

[4:1:66,111] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and  

[4:2:66,121] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-

[4:3:66,130] D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary  

[4:4:66,140] Assistance for Needy Families block grant.  

[4:5:66,157] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION:  

[5:0:66,175] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating  

[5:1:66,184] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The  

[5:2:66,194] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.  

[5:3:66,211] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:  

[6:0:66,229] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal  

[6:1:66,239] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State  

[6:2:66,248] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts  

[6:3:66,258] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support  

[6:4:66,268] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments  

[6:5:66,278] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program  

[6:6:66,287] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[9:0:65,185] • County Administration and Automation Projects  

[10:0:65,201] • Disaster Relief  

[11:0:66,218] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to  

[11:1:66,228] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,  

[11:2:66,238] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.  

[12:0:66,255] 4270010 - CalWORKs:  

[13:0:66,272] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is  

[13:1:66,282] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic  

[13:2:66,292] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes  

[13:3:66,302] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet  

[13:4:66,311] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs  

[13:5:66,321] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Parents have the right to choose child care  

[13:6:66,331] among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both  

[13:7:66,341] goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and development services.  

[14:0:66,358] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:  

[15:0:66,375] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term  

[15:1:66,385] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as  

[15:2:66,395] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is  

[15:3:66,405] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social  

[15:4:66,414] Services as authorized by federal and state law.  

[16:0:66,432] The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to relative guardians of children who were  

[16:1:66,441] previously in the foster care system.  

[17:0:66,459] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate  

[17:1:66,468] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in  

[17:2:66,478] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and  

[17:3:66,488] state law.  

[18:0:66,505] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:  

[19:0:65,523] • The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States  

[19:1:76,532] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.  

[20:0:65,548] • The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and  

[20:1:76,558] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States  

[20:2:76,568] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the  

[20:3:76,577] minor.  

[21:0:65,593] • The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human  

[21:1:76,603] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are  

[21:2:76,613] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under  

[21:3:76,623] CalWORKs).  

[22:0:66,640] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of  

[22:1:66,650] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of  

[22:2:66,659] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations  

[22:3:66,669] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits  

[22:4:66,679] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.  

[22:5:66,689] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program allows certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in  

[22:6:66,698] employment and training activities.

[3:1:66,78] meals. Eligible children are provided with $40 per month for June, July, and August for a total of $120.  

[4:0:66,96] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution  

[4:1:66,105] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for  

[4:2:66,115] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with  

[4:3:66,125] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a  

[4:4:66,135] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.  

[5:0:66,152] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious  

[5:1:66,162] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity  

[5:2:66,171] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services  

[5:3:66,181] on October 1, 2016.  

[6:0:66,198] 4270020 - Child Care and Development:  

[7:0:66,216] The Child Care and Development program reflects services transitioned to the Department of Social Services from the  

[7:1:66,226] Department of Education, effective July 1, 2021. This includes but is not limited to Stages Two and Three of CalWORKs Child  

[7:2:66,235] Care, migrant day care, and Child and Adult Care Food Programs.  

[8:0:66,253] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:  

[9:0:66,262] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled  

[9:1:66,272] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a  

[9:2:66,282] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who  

[9:3:66,292] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.  

[10:0:66,309] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:  

[11:0:66,326] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who  

[11:1:66,336] administer public assistance programs.  

[12:0:66,353] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.  

[13:0:66,371] 4270046 - Disaster Relief:  

[14:0:66,388] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have  

[14:1:66,398] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance  

[14:2:66,407] programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select  

[14:3:66,417] recovery grants.  

[15:0:66,434] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING  

[16:0:66,452] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child  

[16:1:66,461] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and  

[16:2:66,471] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of  

[16:3:66,481] the service delivery system.  

[17:0:66,498] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:  

[18:0:66,516] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in  

[18:1:66,525] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who  

[18:2:66,535] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs  

[18:3:66,545] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,  

[18:4:66,555] and IHSS-Residual Program.  

[19:0:66,572] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:

[21:0:66,616] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and  

[21:1:66,626] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated  

[21:2:66,636] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with  

[21:3:66,646] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and  

[21:4:66,655] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from  

[21:5:66,665] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.  

[22:0:66,682] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is responsible   for implementing continuum of care  

[22:1:66,692] reforms   codified in Chapter 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to  

[22:2:66,702] services without having to change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and  

[22:3:66,712] families in assessment and case planning.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT  

[4:0:66,103] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve  

[4:1:66,113] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability  

[4:2:66,123] for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage  

[4:3:66,133] cost-effective approaches to providing services.  

[5:0:66,152] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[5:1:66,162] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts  

[5:2:66,172] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified  

[5:3:66,181] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to  

[5:4:66,191] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision  

[5:5:66,201] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for  

[5:6:66,211] county health and social services programs.

[2:0:167,32] 5196   2011 State-Local Realignment - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services,  

[3:1:66,78] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is  

[3:2:66,88] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and  

[3:3:66,98] technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at  

[3:4:66,108] less cost.  

[3:5:66,125] The funding sources for realignment are:  

[3:6:65,142] • The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.  

[3:7:65,158] • The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[4:0:66,175] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:  

[4:1:65,192] • Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services)  

[4:2:65,208] • Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care;  

[4:3:76,218] Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment)  

[4:4:65,234] • Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs)  

[4:5:65,250] • Trial Court Security Subaccount  

[5:0:65,265] • Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and  

[5:1:76,275] Adult Parole)
