[5:0:66,177] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,195] 1100 - CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY  

[7:0:66,215] The California Board of Accountancy regulates the largest group of accounting professionals in the nation. By authority of the  

[7:1:66,225] California Accountancy Act, the Board qualifies California candidates for the National Uniform Certified Public Accountant  

[7:2:66,234] (CPA) Examination; certifies, licenses, and renews licenses of individual CPAs and Public Accountants (PA); registers  

[7:3:66,244] accountancy partnerships and corporations; oversees the practice privilege (mobility) program; receives and investigates  

[7:4:66,254] complaints; takes enforcement actions against licensees for violation of Board statutes and regulations; monitors compliance  

[7:5:66,264] with continuing education requirements; and reviews the work products of CPAs, PAs, and CPA firms to ensure adherence to  

[7:6:66,274] professional standards.  

[8:0:66,291] 1105 - CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTS BOARD  

[9:0:66,310] The California Architects Board's objectives are to ensure that only those persons possessing the necessary minimum  

[9:1:66,320] qualifications are licensed as architects, to enforce the provisions of the Architect Practice Act and subsequent regulations, and  

[9:2:66,330] to establish and enforce levels of professional competence, eliminate unlicensed activity, and provide consumer/industry  

[9:3:66,340] education. The Board also maintains purview and jurisdiction over the Landscape Architects Technical Committee, which  

[9:4:66,349] regulates the practice of landscape architecture through the enforcement of the Landscape Architects Practice Act to protect  

[9:5:66,359] consumers, and the public health, safety, and welfare while safeguarding the environment. 

[10:0:66,377] 1110 - STATE ATHLETIC COMMISSION  

[11:0:66,396] The State Athletic Commission approves, manages, and directs all professional and amateur boxing and full-contact martial  

[11:1:66,406] arts events. The Commission protects consumers by making sure bouts are fair and competitive while protecting the health and  

[11:2:66,416] safety of participants.  

[12:0:66,433] 1115 - BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES  

[13:0:66,452] The Board of Behavioral Sciences licenses and regulates Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Clinical Social Workers,  

[13:1:66,462] Licensed Educational Psychologists, and Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors. The confidential and sensitive nature of  

[13:2:66,472] services these licensees perform necessitates the development and enforcement of performance standards and competence  

[13:3:66,482] consistent with the public welfare. The Board ensures minimum competency standards are met by establishing educational and  

[13:4:66,492] experience requirements, conducting examinations, investigating violations of professional ethics and law, and disciplining  

[13:5:66,501] licensees when appropriate.  

[14:0:66,519] 1120 - BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS  

[15:0:66,538] The Board of Chiropractic Examiners protects California consumers from fraudulent, negligent, or incompetent practices of  

[15:1:66,548] chiropractic care. The Board ensures providers are adequately trained and meet recognized standards of performance for  

[15:2:66,558] treatment and practice. The Board uses licensing, continuing education, and disciplinary procedures to maintain those  

[15:3:66,567] standards. It also sets educational standards for recognized chiropractic colleges, reviews complaints, and investigates  

[15:4:66,577] possible violations of the Chiropractic Act and regulations.  

[16:0:66,595] 1125 - BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY  

[17:0:66,614] The Board of Barbering and Cosmetology licenses barbers, cosmetologists, electrologists, estheticians, and manicurists after  

[17:1:66,624] determining, through an examination, that applicants possess the minimum skills and qualifications necessary to provide safe  

[17:2:66,634] and effective services to the public. The Board conducts both routine and directed health and safety inspections of licensed
