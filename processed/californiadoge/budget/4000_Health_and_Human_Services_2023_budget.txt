[6:0:66,310] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:1:66,329] 3831 - HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY  

[7:0:66,346] The Hospital Fair Billing Program receives and investigates consumer complaints regarding hospital billing and enforces the  

[7:1:66,356] hospital fair pricing policies. The Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) has three primary responsibilities: managing cost  

[7:2:66,366] growth targets, monitoring system performance, and assessing market consolidation. OHCA will collect, analyze, and publicly  

[7:3:66,375] report data on total health care expenditures, and enforce cost growth targets set by a new Health Care Affordability Board. To  

[7:4:66,385] ensure a balanced approach to managing costs, OHCA will monitor system performance by measuring quality, equity, adoption  

[7:5:66,395] of alternative payment models, investment in primary care and behavioral health, and workforce stability. Through cost and  

[7:6:66,405] market impact reviews, OHCA will analyze transactions that are likely to significantly impact on market competition, the state’s  

[7:7:66,415] ability to meet cost targets, or affordability for consumers and purchasers. Based on results of the review, OHCA will then  

[7:8:66,424] coordinate with other state agencies to address consolidation as appropriate.  

[7:9:66,442] 3835 - HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE  

[8:0:66,461] The Health Care Workforce Program improves access to medical, mental, and dental health care providers in underserved  

[8:1:66,471] areas throughout California. The Program conducts research to identify areas of unmet need and administers grants that  

[8:2:66,481] provide financial incentives to individuals and institutions to increase the number of providers in those areas. The Program  

[8:3:66,490] promotes health care workforce diversity and cultural competency. It includes the following programs:  

[8:4:65,508] • Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Program  

[8:5:65,523] • Mental Health Services Act Workforce Education and Training Program  

[8:6:65,539] • Health Professions Careers Opportunity Program  

[8:7:65,555] • Health Workforce Pilot Projects Program  

[8:8:65,571] • Health Workforce Research Data Center  

[8:9:65,587] • California's Primary Care Office, which includes:  

[8:10:74,604] ◦ Shortage Designation Program  

[8:11:74,620] ◦ State Office of Rural Health 

[8:12:74,635] ◦ J-1 Visa Waiver Program  

[9:0:65,659] • California Health Workforce Education and Training Council  

[9:1:65,674] • Scholarship Programs  

[10:0:65,690] • Loan Repayment Programs, including the California State Loan Repayment Program, Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps  

[10:1:76,700] Loan Repayment Program and Licensed Mental Health Services Provider Education Program  

[10:2:65,716] • Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Workforce Programs

[1:0:412,13] 2023-24 STATE BUDGET — HHS   13 

[2:0:107,32] 4140   Department of Health Care Access and Information - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] 3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT  

[4:0:66,86] The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and  

[4:1:66,96] construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of  

[4:2:66,105] providing sustained services to the public.  

[4:3:66,123] 3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE  

[5:0:66,142] The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and  

[5:1:66,152] nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors  

[5:2:66,162] the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating  

[5:3:66,171] access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California.  

[5:4:66,189] The Distressed Hospital Loan Program requires HCAI and the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (CHFFA) to  

[5:5:66,198] collaboratively administer the Distressed Hospital Loan Program to offer interest-free, working capital loans to non-profit and  

[5:6:66,208] publicly-operated financially distressed hospitals, including hospitals that belong to integrated health care systems with no more  

[5:7:66,218] than two separately licensed hospitals in California that are facing a risk of closure, while they implement turnaround strategies  

[5:8:66,228] to regain financial viability.   HCAI contracts with CHFFA through an Inter-Agency Agreement to administer the loan program. 

[5:9:66,238] The founding legislation also includes provisions requiring hospitals to submit quarterly financial data to HCAI, for use in  

[5:10:66,247] monitoring the financial health of hospitals throughout the state.  

[5:11:66,265] 3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 

[6:0:66,282] The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from  

[7:0:66,292] approximately 9,500 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment  

[7:1:66,301] data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory  

[7:2:66,311] surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers,  

[7:3:66,321] health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this  

[7:4:66,331] mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and  

[7:5:66,341] analyze prescription drug cost data, hospital supplier diversity data, hospital quality and equity data, and health care payment  

[7:6:66,350] data to improve transparency, inform policy decisions, reduce disparities, and reduce health care costs. 

[7:7:66,368] 3860 - ADMINISTRATION  

[8:0:66,387] Administration provides overall management, planning, policy development, legal, legislative, information technology support  

[8:1:66,397] and administrative services to HCAI.

[8:0:66,507] The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60  

[8:1:66,517] years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the  

[8:2:66,527] isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and

[6:0:207,254] 4265   Department of Public Health  

[7:0:66,275] The California Department of Public Health (DPH) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all Californians  

[7:1:66,285] through the following core activities:  

[7:2:65,302] • Protecting the public from communicable diseases.  

[8:0:65,318] • Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments, and improving social determinants of health and healthy  

[8:1:76,328] communities.  

[9:0:65,343] • Preventing disease, injury, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities by embedding  

[9:1:76,353] health and mental health equity language, tools, and approaches into all public health and partner agency policies, practices,  

[9:2:76,363] programs, systems, and resource allocation.  

[9:3:65,379] • Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.  

[10:0:65,395] • Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to  

[10:1:76,404] guide public health strategies, programs, and actions.  

[11:0:65,420] • Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces.  

[11:1:65,436] • Providing access to quality, population-based health services.  

[12:0:66,453] Because DPH's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support  

[12:1:66,463] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[12:0:176,512] 4300   Department of Developmental Services  

[13:0:66,533] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for  

[13:1:66,542] overseeing the coordination and delivery of services and supports that persons with developmental disabilities need to lead  

[13:2:66,552] more independent and productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy  

[13:3:66,562] and provides leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities and standards within which the  

[13:4:66,572] developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems  

[13:5:66,582] that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies  

[13:6:66,591] known as regional centers as well as through state-operated facilities. The Department, through contracts with the 21 regional  

[13:7:66,601] centers, oversees through audits and other review the coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities;  

[13:8:66,611] provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their  

[13:9:66,621] lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community.  

[14:0:66,638] Because the Department of Developmental Services' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has  

[14:1:66,648] a capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[14:2:66,657] Overview."

[10:0:66,504] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[11:0:66,523] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of facilities under its control,  

[11:1:66,532] including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities  

[11:2:66,542] are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County.  

[11:3:66,559] The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet in 319 buildings on 784 acres. As of  

[11:4:66,569] February 2020, the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former residents  

[11:5:66,579] to community living. The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until disposition of  

[11:6:66,589] the property. The Department is projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR)  

[11:7:66,598] residences that provide acute crisis services in the community. Additionally, the Department is responsible for the maintenance  

[11:8:66,608] of interior finishes and equipment at Canyon Springs, a 57,000-square-foot leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities  

[11:9:66,618] support the Department's mission in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; and  

[11:10:66,628] vocational training for residents with developmental disabilities committed to a state-operated facility.

[10:0:201,456] 4440   Department of State Hospitals  

[11:0:66,477] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is  

[11:1:66,487] to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, by leading innovation and excellence across a  

[11:2:66,497] continuum of care and settings. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health treatment of its  

[11:3:66,506] patients. The Department oversees five state hospitals located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and  

[11:4:66,516] Patton,   and employs over 13,000 staff. In addition to the state hospital treatment,   the Department provides services in  

[11:5:66,526] contracted jail-based competency treatment (JBCT), community-based restoration (CBR), community inpatient facilities and  

[11:6:66,536] pre-trial felony mental health diversion programs, and the conditional release program (CONREP).  

[11:7:66,553] Because the Department programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[11:8:66,563] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,68] Department of State Hospitals Headquarters includes a Hospital Administration component. Hospital Administration includes  

[3:1:66,78] centralized functions and services that directly affect patient care in DSH hospitals but are administered centrally from  

[3:2:66,88] headquarters such as: technology services, hospital police and fire oversight, patient referral management, clinical recruitment,  

[3:3:66,98] patient benefit and billing management, and Medicare revenue collection.  

[4:0:66,115] 4410 - STATE HOSPITALS  

[5:0:66,132] The state hospital system includes five state hospitals located at Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and  

[5:1:66,142] Patton. Mental health treatment services at all facilities are delivered by clinical teams who provide full-time inpatient care to  

[5:2:66,152] those with serious mental illness and are   predominantly ordered for treatment by a criminal or civil court or by the Board of  

[5:3:66,162] Parole Hearings. To a lesser extent, the Department of State Hospitals also receives referrals for state hospital treatment from  

[5:4:66,171] county behavioral health departments or the public guardians, as well as from the California Department of Corrections and

[1:0:407,13] 2023-24 STATE BUDGET — HHS   147 

[2:0:166,32] 4440   Department of State Hospitals - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Conditional Release Program is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients.  

[3:1:66,78] Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began operations on  

[3:2:66,88] January 1, 1986.  

[4:0:66,105] 4420010 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,123] The Conditional Release Program General/Non-Sexually Violent Predators is comprised of   NGI, OMD, and IST. Individuals  

[5:1:66,132] suitable for this program may be recommended by the state hospital medical director to the courts for outpatient treatment.  

[5:2:66,142] Currently, DSH contracts with seven county-operated and three private organizations   serving all 58 counties in the state with  

[5:3:66,152] non-SVP commitments.  

[6:0:66,169] 4420020 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM -   SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS  

[7:0:66,186] The Conditional Release Program-Sexually Violent Predators was added to the Conditional Release Program effective January  

[7:1:66,196] 1, 1996 per Welfare and Institutions Code 6604. Prior to the conditional release of the first   SVP in 2003,   conditional release  

[7:2:66,206] providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators as patients, requiring the  

[7:3:66,216] Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving 58 counties. Current  

[7:4:66,226] statute requires SVPs be conditionally released to their county of domicile and sufficient funding be available to provide  

[7:5:66,235] treatment and supervision services when an   SVP is conditionally released into the community by court order.  

[8:0:66,253] 4430 - CONTRACTED PATIENT SERVICES  

[9:0:66,270] The Department of State Hospitals contracts with local entities to provide mental health services to some of its patients outside  

[9:1:66,280] of state hospital facilities. This includes the   Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Centers, Jail-Based Competency  

[9:2:66,289] Treatment programs, IST Diversion programs, Community-Based Restoration programs and Community Inpatient Facility  

[9:3:66,299] programs.  

[10:0:66,316] 4430010 - ADMISSION, EVALUATION, STABILIZATION CENTER 

[11:0:66,334] The Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County Jail receives   IST patients committed to the  

[11:1:66,344] Department of State Hospitals from counties across the state. Patients receive a full evaluation upon admission to determine  

[11:2:66,353] whether they can be treated through the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center on a short-term basis or may need  

[11:3:66,363] longer-term state hospital treatment. Patients considered to be short-term can be treated and discharged directly from the  

[11:4:66,373] Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center.  

[12:0:66,390] 4430020 - JAIL-BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT  

[13:0:66,407] The Jail-Based Competency Treatment Program focuses on defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial and provides  

[13:1:66,417] mental health treatment to defendants in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court  

[13:2:66,427] proceedings. 

[14:0:66,444] 4430030 - OTHER CONTRACTED SERVICES  

[15:0:66,461] The Other Contracted Services includes additional contracts with local entities to provide mental health services to some of its  

[15:1:66,471] patients outside of state hospital facilities. Programs include IST Diversion and Community-Based Restoration programs. 

[16:0:66,489] 4430040 - The Other Contracted Services focuses on policy development, program management and oversight of Jail Based  

[16:1:66,498] Treatment Programs and Community Based IST Programs.  

[17:0:66,516] 4430050 - The Jail Based Treatment Programs focus on defendants deemed IST on felony charges and provides mental health  

[17:1:66,525] treatment to these individuals in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court proceedings.  

[18:0:66,543] 4430060 - The Community Based Incompetent to Stand Trial programs are partnerships with various counties to treat felony  

[18:1:66,552] IST in a community mental health treatment setting. This includes Community-Based Restoration, Diversion and Community  

[18:2:66,562] Inpatient Facilities.  

[19:0:66,579] 4440 - EVALUATION AND FORENSIC SERVICES  

[20:0:66,597] Evaluation and Forensic Services is comprised of the   OMD and the Sex Offender Commitment Programs. Penal Code  

[20:1:66,606] Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of Parole Hearings to be  

[20:2:66,616] treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs evaluations to determine if  

[20:3:66,626] individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the   OMD program. These evaluations are used by the Board of Parole Hearings  

[20:4:66,636] in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and  

[20:5:66,646] Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new  

[20:6:66,655] category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to be an SVP. The Sex Offender Commitment  

[20:7:66,665] Program administers clinical screenings and performs evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for  

[20:8:66,675] an SVP commitment to the Department of State Hospitals upon completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the  

[20:9:66,685] ultimate determination whether an individual is likely to be an SVP and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the  

[20:10:66,694] Department of State Hospitals.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES  

[5:0:66,101] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities through  

[5:1:66,111] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that individuals with  

[5:2:66,121] disabilities may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In  

[5:3:66,130] addition, the Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education,  

[5:4:66,140] behavioral/mental health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of  

[5:5:66,150] Selection process, which gives priority to individuals with the most significant disabilities.  

[6:0:66,167] Individuals with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range  

[6:1:66,177] of services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement,  

[6:2:66,187] supported employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their  

[6:3:66,196] communities. The Department provides Work Incentives Planning services to reduce dependency on public benefits. The  

[6:4:66,206] Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals working in non-

[6:5:66,216] competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment.  

[7:0:66,233] The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and  

[7:1:66,243] auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16 up to  

[7:2:66,253] 22 (depending on their exit from their special education program), including many who may benefit from early career  

[7:3:66,263] development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary  

[7:4:66,272] education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy. 

[8:0:66,290] The Department, through its Business Enterprises Program, provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to  

[8:1:66,299] enable individuals who are blind or visually impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and  

[8:2:66,309] cafeterias. Prevocational, including employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to  

[8:3:66,319] consumers with vision loss to prepare them for independent living.  

[9:0:66,336] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation  

[9:1:66,346] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and  

[9:2:66,356] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.  

[10:0:66,373] The Department, in partnership with the Department of Developmental Services, implements strategic initiatives to increase the  

[10:1:66,383] employment of individuals with disabilities through the Disability Employment Program. The Department initiates a targeted  

[10:2:66,393] marketing campaign and incentivizes employers to hire individuals with disabilities through technical assistance, workplace  

[10:3:66,402] accessibility, and support training.  

[11:0:66,420] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES  

[12:0:66,437] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout  

[12:1:66,447] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently   with full  

[12:2:66,457] inclusion   in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems  

[12:3:66,466] change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion  

[12:4:66,476] services to community-based living, and   transition services to postsecondary life for youth.  

[13:0:66,493] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their  

[13:1:66,503] families, six service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for individuals with  

[13:2:66,513] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for  

[13:3:66,523] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to  

[13:4:66,532] administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a  

[13:5:66,542] TBI state plan, sustainability plan, statewide TBI registry, and needs assessment.  

[14:0:66,559] In addition, the Department expands the capacity of existing TBI sites and stand up new TBI sites in alignment with Home and  

[14:1:66,569] Community-Based Services surrounding transition and diversion through community reintegration, personal care services  

[14:2:66,579] through supported living services, and other supportive services to improve functional capabilities of individuals with TBI.  

[15:0:66,596] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 17 non-profit community-based  

[15:1:66,606] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually  

[15:2:66,616] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low  

[15:3:66,626] vision evaluations/screenings, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills,  

[15:4:66,635] independent living skills training, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.  

[16:0:66,653] Through a partnership with the California Public Utilities Commission’s Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, the  

[16:1:66,662] Department’s Voice Options program provides eligible Californians who are unable to speak, or who have difficulty speaking,  

[16:2:66,672] with a free speech-generating device. The goal of this program is to ensure full and equal telephone communications access  

[16:3:66,682] for all Californians with disabilities.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,101] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing  

[4:1:66,111] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and  

[4:2:66,121] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-

[4:3:66,130] D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary  

[4:4:66,140] Assistance for Needy Families block grant.  

[4:5:66,157] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION:  

[5:0:66,175] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating  

[5:1:66,184] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The  

[5:2:66,194] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.  

[5:3:66,211] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:  

[6:0:66,229] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal  

[6:1:66,239] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State  

[6:2:66,248] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts  

[6:3:66,258] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support  

[6:4:66,268] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments  

[6:5:66,278] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program  

[6:6:66,287] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[2:0:166,32] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS  

[5:0:66,101] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support  

[5:1:66,111] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components:  

[6:0:65,128] • California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)  

[7:0:65,144] • Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food  

[7:1:76,154] Assistance Programs  

[8:0:65,169] • Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program  

[9:0:65,185] • County Administration and Automation Projects  

[10:0:65,201] • Disaster Relief  

[11:0:66,218] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to  

[11:1:66,228] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,  

[11:2:66,238] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.  

[12:0:66,255] 4270010 - CalWORKs:  

[13:0:66,272] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is  

[13:1:66,282] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic  

[13:2:66,292] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes  

[13:3:66,302] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet  

[13:4:66,311] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs  

[13:5:66,321] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Parents have the right to choose child care  

[13:6:66,331] among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both  

[13:7:66,341] goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and development services.  

[14:0:66,358] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:  

[15:0:66,375] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term  

[15:1:66,385] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as  

[15:2:66,395] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is  

[15:3:66,405] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social  

[15:4:66,414] Services as authorized by federal and state law.  

[16:0:66,432] The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to relative guardians of children who were  

[16:1:66,441] previously in the foster care system.  

[17:0:66,459] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate  

[17:1:66,468] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in  

[17:2:66,478] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and  

[17:3:66,488] state law.  

[18:0:66,505] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:  

[19:0:65,523] • The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States  

[19:1:76,532] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.  

[20:0:65,548] • The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and  

[20:1:76,558] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States  

[20:2:76,568] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the  

[20:3:76,577] minor.  

[21:0:65,593] • The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human  

[21:1:76,603] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are  

[21:2:76,613] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under  

[21:3:76,623] CalWORKs).  

[22:0:66,640] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of  

[22:1:66,650] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of  

[22:2:66,659] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations  

[22:3:66,669] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits  

[22:4:66,679] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.  

[22:5:66,689] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program allows certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in  

[22:6:66,698] employment and training activities.

[1:0:419,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:166,32] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution  

[3:1:66,78] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for  

[3:2:66,88] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with  

[3:3:66,98] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a  

[3:4:66,108] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.  

[4:0:66,125] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious  

[4:1:66,135] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity  

[4:2:66,144] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services  

[4:3:66,154] on October 1, 2016.  

[5:0:66,171] 4270020 - Child Care and Development:  

[6:0:66,189] The Child Care and Development program reflects services transitioned to the Department of Social Services from the  

[6:1:66,198] Department of Education, effective July 1, 2021. This includes but is not limited to Stages Two and Three of CalWORKs Child  

[6:2:66,208] Care, migrant day care, and Child and Adult Care Food Programs.  

[7:0:66,226] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:  

[8:0:66,235] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled  

[8:1:66,245] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a  

[8:2:66,255] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who  

[8:3:66,265] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.  

[9:0:66,282] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:  

[10:0:66,299] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who  

[10:1:66,309] administer public assistance programs.  

[11:0:66,326] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.  

[12:0:66,344] 4270046 - Disaster Relief:  

[13:0:66,361] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have  

[13:1:66,371] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance  

[13:2:66,380] programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select  

[13:3:66,390] recovery grants.  

[14:0:66,407] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING  

[15:0:66,425] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child  

[15:1:66,434] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and  

[15:2:66,444] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of  

[15:3:66,454] the service delivery system.  

[16:0:66,471] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:  

[17:0:66,489] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in  

[17:1:66,498] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who  

[17:2:66,508] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs  

[17:3:66,518] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,  

[17:4:66,528] and IHSS-Residual Program.  

[18:0:66,545] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:  

[19:0:66,562] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse  

[19:1:66,572] Prevention.  

[20:0:66,589] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and  

[20:1:66,599] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated  

[20:2:66,609] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with  

[20:3:66,619] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and  

[20:4:66,628] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from  

[20:5:66,638] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT  

[5:0:66,103] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve  

[5:1:66,113] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability  

[5:2:66,123] for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage  

[5:3:66,133] cost-effective approaches to providing services.  

[6:0:66,152] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[6:1:66,162] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts  

[6:2:66,172] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified  

[6:3:66,181] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to  

[6:4:66,191] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision  

[6:5:66,201] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for  

[6:6:66,211] county health and social services programs.

[12:0:66,516] Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a  

[12:1:66,525] dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility.  

[12:2:66,543] Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services,  

[12:3:66,552] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is  

[12:4:66,562] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and  

[12:5:66,572] technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at  

[12:6:66,582] less cost.  

[12:7:66,599] The funding sources for realignment are:  

[12:8:65,616] • The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.  

[12:9:65,632] • The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[12:10:66,649] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:  

[12:11:65,667] • Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services)  

[12:12:65,682] • Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care;  

[12:13:76,692] Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment)
