[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2019-20 STATE BUDGET — EDU   1 

[1:0:216,43] 6100   Department of Education  

[2:0:66,64] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of  

[2:1:66,74] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million  

[3:0:66,84] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Systems Support Branch; the Teaching  

[3:1:66,95] and Learning Support Branch; the Performance, Planning, and Technology Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch.  

[4:0:66,115] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to  

[4:1:66,125] work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding  

[5:0:66,135] local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to  

[5:1:66,146] enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and  

[6:0:66,156] supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that  

[6:1:66,166] promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the  

[7:0:66,176] administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing  

[8:0:66,186] broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering  

[8:1:66,197] systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help  

[8:2:66,207] students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that  

[9:0:66,217] promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the  

[9:1:66,227] effectiveness and efficiency of the Department.  

[10:0:66,248] Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[10:1:66,258] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[1:0:112,43] 6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System  

[2:0:66,64] The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS).  

[3:0:66,82] The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members'  

[3:1:66,92] creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an  

[3:2:66,102] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on  

[3:3:66,112] July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three  

[3:4:66,123] years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase  

[3:5:66,133] the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.  

[4:0:66,150] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in  

[4:1:66,161] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing  

[4:2:66,171] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection  

[4:3:66,181] payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to  

[4:4:66,191] set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to  

[4:5:66,201] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an  

[4:6:66,212] amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding  

[4:7:66,222] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15  

[4:8:66,232] of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’  

[4:9:66,242] Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)  

[4:10:66,252] increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[12:0:66,500] Education Code, Title 1, Division 1, Part 13, Chapter 16.  

[13:0:66,537] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[14:0:65,555] • The Budget includes $3.3 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The roughly $241 million increase from  

[14:1:76,565] the previous fiscal year is due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its authority to  

[14:2:76,575] increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law in 2014.  

[15:0:65,592] • In addition to the state’s statutorily-required annual contribution, the Budget includes a $1.1 billion supplemental pension  

[15:1:76,602] payment towards the state’s share of the unfunded liability for the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program. This amount is the first  

[15:2:76,612] installment payment out of an estimated $2.9 billion to be paid to CalSTRS through 2022-23 using available Proposition 2  

[15:3:76,622] debt payment funding.  

[16:0:65,638] • Additionally, the Budget includes $2.25 billion General Fund in 2018-19 to be paid to CalSTRS on behalf of school  

[17:0:76,649] employers. Of this amount, roughly $606 million will supplant school employer contributions to CalSTRS over the next two  

[17:1:76,659] fiscal years, reducing the contribution rate by 1.03 percent in 2019-20 and by 0.70 percent in 2020-21. The remaining $1.64  

[17:2:76,669] billion will be paid towards the school employers’ share of the unfunded liability for the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program.

[1:0:202,43] 6350   School Facilities Aid Program  

[2:0:66,64] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities  

[2:1:66,74] such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.   This program is administered by the State Allocation  

[2:2:66,84] Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 

[3:0:66,105] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility  

[3:1:66,115] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in  

[3:2:66,125] statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.   These funds primarily  

[3:3:66,135] support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through  

[3:4:66,146] the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding  

[3:5:66,156] relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7)  

[3:6:66,166] seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general  

[3:7:66,176] obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3  

[3:8:66,186] billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical  

[3:9:66,197] education projects. 

[4:0:66,214] The 2018 and 2019 Budget Acts provided one-time General Fund to support the Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant  

[4:1:66,225] Program to help school districts address the facility costs associated with providing full-day kindergarten programs.   The Full-

[4:2:66,235] Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program is also administered by the State Allocation Board.

[5:0:66,243] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,261] 5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS  

[7:0:66,281] This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure  

[7:1:66,291] a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students.  

[8:0:66,312] The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 290,000 applications annually for  

[8:1:66,322] credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the  

[8:2:66,332] primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential  

[8:3:66,342] personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued.  

[9:0:66,363] The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas,  

[9:1:66,373] aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including  

[9:2:66,383] the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and  

[9:3:66,393] development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the  

[9:4:66,404] Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to  

[9:5:66,414] monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of  

[9:6:66,424] program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program  

[9:7:66,434] approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated  

[9:8:66,444] assignments in collaboration with county offices of education.  

[10:0:66,465] The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal  

[10:1:66,475] advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of  

[10:2:66,485] Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and

[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2019-20 STATE BUDGET — EDU   51 

[1:0:221,43] 6440   University of California  

[2:0:66,64] The University of California (UC) provides higher education through (1) instruction in undergraduate, graduate, and  

[3:0:66,74] professional degree programs and postdoctoral programs; (2) research; (3) education for professional careers; and (4) public  

[3:1:66,84] service.  

[4:0:66,105] The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of  

[4:1:66,115] 1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California.   The Board of Regents includes the  

[4:2:66,125] following 26 members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for  

[4:3:66,135] 12-year terms, and 1 student appointed by the Board.   The Governor is President of the Regents.  

[5:0:66,156] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates the UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for  

[6:0:66,166] research.   In addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment  

[6:1:66,176] primarily responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law.  

[7:0:66,197] There are ten UC campuses as follows: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco,  

[7:1:66,207] Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz.   Nine of these are general campuses and offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional  

[7:2:66,217] education.   The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching  

[8:0:66,227] hospitals in the counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange.   The university administers more  

[8:1:66,237] than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs.   The university provides oversight of one United States  

[8:2:66,248] Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories.  

[9:0:66,268] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource  

[9:1:66,278] allocation.   The 10 chancellors are responsible for management of individual campuses.   The Regents have delegated authority  

[9:2:66,288] to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

[3:1:66,94] 5530 - This program provides support for Hastings.   Expenditures are for the following purposes:  

[4:0:66,115] INSTRUCTION  

[5:0:66,135] Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal  

[5:1:66,145] profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services.  

[6:0:66,166] The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal  

[6:1:66,176] profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students  

[6:2:66,186] with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism  

[6:3:66,196] for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in  

[6:4:66,207] overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice.  

[7:0:66,227] ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY  

[8:0:66,247] The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference

[8:2:66,268] presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law

[10:3:66,349] students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment  

[10:4:66,360] opportunities.   These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support  

[10:5:66,370] Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other  

[10:6:66,380] services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students).

[1:0:212,43] 6610   California State University  

[1:1:66,64] The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses.   All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate  

[1:2:66,74] instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs.   For undergraduate programs, each campus  

[1:3:66,84] requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student.   In addition to master's-level  

[1:4:66,95] graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and audiology.   The  

[1:5:66,105] CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions.  

[1:6:66,123] The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16  

[1:7:66,133] members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student  

[1:8:66,143] representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year  

[1:9:66,153] term by the CSU Alumni Council.   The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents.   The Trustees, the  

[1:10:66,163] Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy.   The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty  

[1:11:66,174] representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor.  

[1:12:66,191] The CSU’s goals include:  

[2:0:65,209] • Offering degree programs in academic and applied areas that are responsive to the needs of citizens of this state and  

[2:1:76,219] providing for regular review of the nature and extent of these programs.  

[2:2:65,235] • Providing public services to the people of California.  

[2:3:65,252] • Providing services to students enrolled in the university.  

[3:0:65,268] • Offering instruction at the doctoral level jointly with the University of California and with private institutions of postsecondary  

[3:1:76,278] education, or independently in the fields of education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and audiology.

[3:0:66,69] An auxiliary enterprise exists to furnish goods or services to students, faculty, or staff, other institutional departments, or  

[3:1:66,79] incidentally to the general public, and charges a fee directly related to the cost of the goods or services.   The distinguishing  

[3:2:66,89] characteristic of an auxiliary enterprise is that it is managed as an essentially self-supporting activity.   Examples are residence  

[3:3:66,99] halls, food services, intercollegiate athletics (only if essentially self-supporting), college stores, faculty clubs, parking, and  

[3:4:66,109] faculty housing.

[1:0:164,43] 6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants  

[2:0:66,64] This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their  

[2:1:66,74] dependents.  

[3:0:66,95] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health  

[3:1:66,105] plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed.  

[4:0:66,125] The 2018-19 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established  

[4:1:66,135] in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members  

[4:2:66,146] hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest  

[4:3:66,156] health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also  

[4:4:66,166] contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents.  

[5:0:66,186] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[5:1:66,197] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2018 monthly contribution  

[5:2:66,207] maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or  

[5:3:66,217] more dependents. The 2019 monthly contribution maximums are $734 for a single enrollee, $1,398 for an enrollee and one  

[5:4:66,227] dependent, and $1,788 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

[1:0:122,43] 6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges  

[2:0:66,64] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to  

[3:0:66,74] California's 73 community college districts, which operate 115 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed by  

[3:1:66,84] the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student  

[3:2:66,95] members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms.  

[4:0:66,115] The objectives of the Board are to:  

[4:1:65,133] • Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.  

[5:0:65,149] • Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.  

[6:0:65,165] • Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.  

[7:0:66,183] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a  

[7:1:66,193] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see  

[7:2:66,203] "Infrastructure Overview."
