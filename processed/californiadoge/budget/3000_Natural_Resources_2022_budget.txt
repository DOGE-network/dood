[1:0:242,39] 3100   Exposition Park  

[2:0:66,61] The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are  

[2:1:66,71] located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these  

[2:2:66,81] three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park.  

[3:0:66,99] The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park  

[3:1:66,109] usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of  

[3:2:66,119] the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve,  

[3:3:66,129] and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the  

[3:4:66,139] western United States.  

[4:0:66,157] Because   the Science Center's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the   Science Center   has a capital outlay  

[4:1:66,167] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,355] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,375] 2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER  

[7:0:66,395] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and  

[7:1:66,405] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops  

[7:2:66,415] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.  

[8:0:66,436] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological  

[8:1:66,446] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,  

[8:2:66,456] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. The Science Center’s Air and Space Center, the permanent home  

[8:3:66,466] for the Space Shuttle Endeavour, will be constructed by the California Science Center Foundation. In July 2021, the Foundation  

[8:4:66,477] reached the fundraising threshold required to begin construction. The entire bond financing process was completed in October  

[8:5:66,487] 2021, and construction is expected to begin in early 2022.  

[9:0:66,507] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The  

[9:1:66,517] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and  

[9:2:66,528] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a  

[9:3:66,538] Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The  

[9:4:66,548] school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards.  

[10:0:66,568] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those  

[10:1:66,579] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding  

[10:2:66,589] support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.  

[11:0:66,607] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,627] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management  

[12:1:66,637] and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events,  

[12:2:66,647] and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is  

[12:3:66,658] responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of  

[12:4:66,668] park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park  

[12:5:66,678] Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in  

[12:6:66,688] addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood.

[2:0:207,32] 3100   Exposition Park - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the  

[3:1:66,79] Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of  

[3:2:66,89] African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African  

[3:3:66,99] American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear  

[3:4:66,109] campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility  

[3:5:66,120] in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public  

[3:6:66,130] programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture,  

[3:7:66,140] historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and  

[3:8:66,150] to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at  

[3:9:66,160] large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty  

[3:10:66,171] years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an  

[3:11:66,181] inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

[13:0:201,522] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy  

[14:0:66,543] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational  

[14:1:66,553] resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs  

[14:2:66,564] that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants for or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed  

[14:3:66,574] restoration; and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances  

[14:4:66,584] these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by  

[14:5:66,594] acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.  

[15:0:66,615] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to  

[15:1:66,625] restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.   The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the  

[15:2:66,635] Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed  

[15:3:66,645] to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[15:4:66,655] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 

[16:0:66,676] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program  

[16:1:66,686] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,427] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,447] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY  

[6:0:66,464] The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-

[6:1:66,475] acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have  

[6:2:66,485] significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits  

[6:3:66,495] and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments.  

[6:4:66,505] Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the  

[6:5:66,515] Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities,  

[6:6:66,526] including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe.  

[7:0:66,543] The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to  

[7:1:66,554] more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a  

[7:2:66,564] wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also  

[7:3:66,574] increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire,  

[7:4:66,584] clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This  

[7:5:66,594] work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change.  

[7:6:66,612] The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site  

[7:7:66,622] improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating  

[7:8:66,632] public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake.  

[7:9:66,650] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  

[8:0:66,671] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing  

[8:1:66,681] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide  

[8:2:66,691] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds  

[8:3:66,701] such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.  

[9:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:166,32] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting  

[3:1:66,79] urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive  

[3:2:66,89] Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town  

[3:3:66,99] center objectives.   Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other  

[3:4:66,109] environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

[5:0:66,161] The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat,  

[5:1:66,171] watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer

[5:3:66,192] 1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local  

[5:4:66,202] governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[5:5:66,212] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

[6:0:200,511] 3340   California Conservation Corps  

[7:0:66,532] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires,  

[8:0:66,542] floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at  

[8:1:66,552] public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become  

[8:2:66,563] strong workers and citizens.  

[9:0:66,583] In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that  

[9:1:66,593] are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities.  

[10:0:66,614] Because the   CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this  

[10:1:66,624] need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:66,369] Public Resources Code Section 14000 - 14424.  

[7:0:66,406] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:0:74,426] ◦ Wildfire and Forest Resilience Package—The Budget includes $400 million General Fund in 2022-23 as part of a $1.2  

[8:1:85,436] billion package of investments that target the state’s wildfire risks. Of the total $1.2 billion, $730 million will be allocated at  

[8:2:85,446] a later time.   This includes $15 million in 2022-23 for the California Conservation Corps to invest in the Forestry Corps.  

[8:3:74,462] ◦ Enhancing and Expanding California Conservation Corps Fire Crews—The Budget includes $8.1 million General Fund,  

[8:4:85,473] with an offsetting decrease of $1.8 million Collins-Dugan Reimbursement Account, to support additional CAL FIRE/Corps  

[8:5:85,483] fire crews to enhance CAL FIRE’S fire prevention and suppression capabilities.  

[9:0:74,499] ◦ Equipment Replacement—The Budget includes $7.3 million one-time General Fund to replace a portion of an aging fleet,  

[9:1:85,509] which are critical in transporting crews to project sites and emergency response locations.  

[10:0:74,525] ◦ Fire Crews—The Budget includes $1,769,000 General Fund in 2022-23, $1,708,000 in 2023-24, $1,994,000 ongoing, and  

[10:1:85,536] 11 positions, to: (1) right-size existing CCC crews, (2) convert 6 existing seasonal CCC crews to year-round crews, and (3)  

[10:2:85,546] add 4 new year-round crews. These proposals will increase the overall number of permanent fire crews available to: (1)  

[10:3:85,556] respond to wildfires throughout the year, (2) implement high-priority fuel reduction projects to protect communities from  

[10:4:85,566] wildfire, and (3) participate in prescribed fire and other fuels treatment projects to achieve more resilient landscapes. This  

[10:5:85,576] package builds upon existing partnerships and will partially offset the projected loss of Department of Corrections and  

[10:6:85,587] Rehabilitation inmate crews.

[3:0:66,69] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 9 residential and 17 non-residential  

[3:1:66,79] facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training,  

[3:2:66,89] and educational opportunities to young adults. The facilities also allow the CCC to assist federal, state and local agencies, as  

[3:3:66,99] well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources.  

[3:4:66,117] The CCC residential facilities house 80 to 100 corpsmembers each and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people  

[3:5:66,127] together from across the state, and increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential  

[3:6:66,137] centers range in size from 30 to 60 corpsmembers and are located in both urban and rural communities throughout California.

[5:2:66,651] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,  

[5:3:66,661] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and  

[5:4:66,671] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets; and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,  

[5:5:66,682] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about  

[5:6:66,692] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.

[1:0:454,13] NATURAL RESOURCES 

[2:0:171,32] 3480   Department of Conservation - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as   much  

[3:1:66,79] as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and  

[3:2:66,89] environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of  

[3:3:66,99] hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for  

[3:4:66,109] program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries. 

[3:5:66,127] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION  

[4:0:66,145] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program  

[4:1:66,155] provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local  

[4:2:66,165] governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts  

[4:3:66,175] for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development  

[4:4:66,186] rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops  

[4:5:66,196] maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use  

[4:6:66,206] decisions.  

[5:0:66,224] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION  

[6:0:66,241] This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface  

[6:1:66,252] Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim  

[6:2:66,262] mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and  

[6:3:66,272] remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.  

[6:4:66,290] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD  

[7:0:66,307] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of  

[7:1:66,318] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine  

[7:2:66,328] Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans,  

[7:3:66,338] and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to  

[7:4:66,348] comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local  

[7:5:66,358] government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

[1:0:164,89] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  

[2:0:66,111] The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue, and  

[3:0:66,121] disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership in the protection of life, property, and natural resources in  

[3:1:66,131] California.  

[4:0:66,152] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety  

[4:1:66,162] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency  

[4:2:66,172] response.  

[5:0:66,192] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing  

[5:1:66,203] diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention  

[5:2:66,213] awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management.  

[6:0:66,233] CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to  

[6:1:66,243] enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland  

[6:2:66,254] areas of California.  

[7:0:66,274] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support  

[7:1:66,284] this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[11:1:66,652] positions, phased in over four years, to staff and support 17 new Firefighter 1 crews and fund associated equipment and  

[11:2:66,662] special repairs. This increase further supports firefighting capabilities and partially offsets the projected loss of Department of  

[11:3:66,673] Corrections and Rehabilitation inmate crews.  

[12:0:66,690] Wildfire and Forest Resilience Package —The Budget includes $50 million General Fund in 2021-22, $305 million ($200  

[12:1:66,701] million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and $105 million General Fund) in 2022-23, as part of a $1.2 billion package of

[0:0:66,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — RES   74 

[1:0:454,13] NATURAL RESOURCES 

[2:0:129,32] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] investments that target the state’s wildfire risks. This includes funding for various program to support and implement projects  

[3:1:66,79] related to wildfire and forest resilience. Of the $1.2 billion, $530 million will be allocated at a later time.  

[4:0:66,97] Additional Fire Hawk Helicopters —The Budget includes $100 million General Fund in 2022-23, $12.7 million ongoing, and 5  

[4:1:66,107] positions to purchase and operate four additional helicopters to support 24/7 operations of the enhanced helicopter fleet.  

[4:2:66,117] California continues to invest in the acquisition and delivery of twelve S70i Fire Hawk helicopters, with 8 of 12 currently in  

[4:3:66,127] California. These larger helicopters have the capability to drop up to 1,000 gallons of water at a time and operate at night,  

[4:4:66,137] which can significantly slow advancing wildfires. The acquisition of four additional helicopters will provide additional aircraft  

[4:5:66,148] availability to help maintain 24/7 flight operations during critical fire weather conditions when frontline helicopters are due for  

[4:6:66,158] maintenance.  

[5:0:66,175] Firefighter Relief Staffing —The Budget includes $97.2 million General Fund in 2022-23, $84.9 million ongoing, and 455  

[5:1:66,186] positions, phased in over four years, to improve the health and wellness of CAL FIRE firefighters and appropriately staff CAL  

[5:2:66,196] FIRE to meet the demands of wildland firefighting in a changing climate. Over the past decade, firefighters from CAL FIRE  

[5:3:66,206] have battled and endured 14 of the 20 largest wildfires in the state's history. Current conditions appear to indicate above  

[5:4:66,216] average wildfire severity and intensity will continue in the coming years.  

[6:0:66,234] July through December 2022 Fire Protection Augmentation —The Budget includes $83.1 million General Fund one-time to  

[6:1:66,244] augment CAL FIRE’s fire protection resources through December 2022 given current drought conditions, increasing fire  

[6:2:66,254] severity and size, and declining inmate camp populations.  

[7:0:66,272] Exclusive Use Type 1 Helitankers —The budget includes $52 million General Fund and 29 positions annually for three years  

[7:1:66,282] to contract for 10 exclusive use helitankers each year while the state awaits the delivery of retardant dropping C-130 aircrafts  

[7:2:66,292] from the federal government. CAL FIRE operates 12 state-owned firefighting helicopters, and 1 firefighting helicopter under  

[7:3:66,303] contract with San Diego County, located strategically at 11 helitack bases across California. This proposal will augment the  

[7:4:66,313] statewide aviation fleet with ten additional heavy helicopters, each capable of dropping 1,000-2,000 gallons of water at a time.  

[8:0:66,331] Direct Mission Support —The Budget includes $37.8 million ($29.3 million General Fund) in 2022-23, $35.6 million ($27.5  

[8:1:66,341] million General Fund) ongoing, and 190 positions to improve operational effectiveness by strengthening and enhancing the  

[8:2:66,351] core administrative and program support critical to sustain CAL FIRE’s direct mission functions in an increasingly complex  

[8:3:66,361] environment.  

[9:0:66,379] Surge Equipment: Fire Engines and Bulldozers —The Budget includes $35.8 million General Fund in 2022-23 and $2.8  

[9:1:66,389] million ongoing for surge capacity dozers and fire engines. CAL FIRE operates 356 frontline fire engines and 59 bulldozers  

[9:2:66,399] across the state. This equipment requires regular maintenance and can have unexpected mechanical breakdowns. This  

[9:3:66,409] proposal will add two surge engines per unit and contract county, and ten additional bulldozers, to provide additional resources  

[9:4:66,420] that can be staffed during critical fire conditions and resource drawdown.  

[10:0:66,437] Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System —The Budget includes $30 million ongoing General Fund, $5.6 million and 20  

[10:1:66,448] positions in CAL FIRE's budget, to establish the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS) program to increase the  

[10:2:66,458] real-time information and situational awareness available to the state and California’s mutual aid system responders and  

[10:3:66,468] managers on all hazards events, including wildfires. FIRIS will utilize a combination of aircraft, high-definition real time video,  

[10:4:66,478] and data analysis dispatched 24/7 throughout the state to provide nearly instantaneous, accurate visual situation awareness  

[10:5:66,488] that informs public safety and emergency management operational and tactical decisions. Early detection and rapid intelligence  

[10:6:66,499] allows for the strategic and efficient allocation of resources before, during, and after disaster incidents, and a more effective  

[10:7:66,509] response to reduce loss of life and property. The intelligence gathered will also provide data and support to the Wildfire  

[10:8:66,519] Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center, as established through SB 209 (Chapter 405, Statutes of 2019).

[7:0:215,393] 3560   State Lands Commission  

[8:0:66,415] The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its  

[8:1:66,425] care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access.  

[8:2:66,435] Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars   in  

[8:3:66,445] revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources.  

[9:0:66,463] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands  

[9:1:66,473] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign  

[9:2:66,483] public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal  

[9:3:66,494] government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands  

[9:4:66,504] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development,  

[9:5:66,514] environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law  

[9:6:66,524] Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the  

[9:7:66,534] trust to the benefit of all Californians.  

[10:0:66,552] Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and  

[10:1:66,562] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high  

[10:2:66,573] water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands,  

[10:3:66,583] which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California.  

[10:4:66,593] School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the  

[10:5:66,603] five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state  

[10:6:66,613] ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest  

[10:7:66,624] in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.  

[11:0:66,641] Because the State Lands Commission’s (SLC) programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, SLC has a capital outlay  

[11:1:66,651] program to support this need. For the specifics on the SLC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,377] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,397] 2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[7:0:66,414] The   Mineral Resources Management Division   oversees the efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands.  

[7:1:66,425] The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the  

[7:2:66,435] safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,  

[7:3:66,445] geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public  

[7:4:66,455] safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources  

[7:5:66,465] through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil  

[7:6:66,476] spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and   conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives  

[7:7:66,486] fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the  

[7:8:66,496] oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction.  

[8:0:66,514] Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-

[8:1:66,524] generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to  

[8:2:66,534] administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program.  

[9:0:66,552] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[10:0:66,569] The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural  

[10:1:66,580] and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public  

[10:2:66,590] Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from   Lake  

[10:3:66,600] Tahoe and   the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast   in the west, and include California’s  

[10:4:66,610] two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin.  

[11:0:66,628] The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local  

[11:1:66,638] jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The  

[11:2:66,648] Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for use or development, preserving  

[11:3:66,659] and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands.  

[12:0:66,676] Finally, the Commission manages the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land  

[12:1:66,686] holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.  

[13:0:66,704] 2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION

[2:0:180,32] 3560   State Lands Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The   Marine Environmental Protection Division   regulates marine oil terminals within California, providing the best achievable  

[3:1:66,79] protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals,  

[3:2:66,89] inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification  

[3:3:66,99] programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit  

[3:4:66,109] for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous  

[3:5:66,120] species into California waters through the operations of oceangoing vessels. The program funds and conducts scientific  

[3:6:66,130] research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing  

[3:7:66,140] vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions.  

[3:8:66,158] 9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION  

[4:0:66,175] The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction, and administrative support to the  

[4:1:66,186] Commission’s line programs.

[10:0:66,426] The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages more than 740 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres  

[10:1:66,436] (approximately 679,000 acres of state-owned land and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the  

[10:2:66,447] Department. Several state agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management  

[10:3:66,457] responsibilities for these properties are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department  

[10:4:66,467] control continues to increase. Examples of the properties managed by the Department include, and are not limited to: 111  

[10:5:66,477] wildlife areas, 136 ecological reserves, 138 public access areas, and 21 fish hatcheries.

[7:0:183,358] 3790   Department of Parks and Recreation  

[8:0:66,379] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and  

[8:1:66,389] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most  

[8:2:66,400] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and  

[8:3:66,410] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the  

[8:4:66,420] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural  

[8:5:66,430] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park

[6:6:66,263] fosters collaboration among governments, public agencies and nonprofit organizations, and leverages grant funding to achieve  

[6:7:66,273] an array of conservation objectives for the region with an emphasis on native habitat restoration and mitigating the impacts of

[8:0:66,356] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water supply. The Department  

[8:1:66,366] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing  

[8:2:66,376] needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to  

[8:3:66,386] prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its  

[8:4:66,396] efficient use.  

[9:0:66,417] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[9:1:66,427] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[9:0:66,544] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN  

[10:0:66,561] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water  

[10:1:66,572] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to  

[10:2:66,582] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water  

[10:3:66,592] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water  

[10:4:66,602] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan  

[10:5:66,612] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,  

[10:6:66,623] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,  

[10:7:66,633] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected  

[10:8:66,643] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare  

[10:9:66,653] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure  

[10:10:66,663] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,  

[10:11:66,674] protection of agriculture, and supporting a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water  

[10:12:66,684] Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local  

[10:13:66,694] agencies and tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination.

[1:0:454,13] NATURAL RESOURCES 

[2:0:161,32] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21  

[3:1:66,79] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,  

[3:2:66,89] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.  

[4:0:66,107] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water  

[4:1:66,117] to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.  

[5:0:66,135] The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,  

[5:1:66,145] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental  

[5:2:66,155] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and  

[5:3:66,165] federal regulations and permits.  

[6:0:66,183] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE  

[7:0:66,201] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper  

[7:1:66,211] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include

[2:0:161,32] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] †   Fiscal year 2020-21 budget information reflects the latest available estimates for this department and/or fund(s). Changes  

[3:1:66,83] resulting from the final reconciliation of the 2020-21 ending fund balance will be reflected as a prior year adjustment in the  

[3:2:66,93] 2023-24 Governor’s Budget publication.  

[4:0:66,131] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[5:0:66,150] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control  

[5:1:66,161] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage  

[5:2:66,171] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700  

[5:3:66,181] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated  

[5:4:66,191] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate  

[5:5:66,201] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the  

[5:6:66,212] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank  

[5:7:66,222] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,  

[5:8:66,232] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood  

[5:9:66,242] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[6:1:66,172] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and  

[6:2:66,182] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and  

[6:3:66,192] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted  

[6:4:66,203] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.  

[6:5:66,213] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other  

[6:6:66,223] relevant agencies.   The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent  

[6:7:66,233] Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to  

[6:8:66,243] inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
