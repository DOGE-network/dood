[1:0:156,44] 5225 Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 

[2:0:58,64] The mission of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is to enhance public safety through safe 

[2:1:58,73] and secure incarceration of offenders, effective parole supervision, and rehabilitative strategies to successfully reintegrate 

[2:2:58,82] offenders into our communities. 

[2:3:58,100] The CDCR is organized into the following programs: 

[2:4:68,118] Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration 

[2:5:68,127] Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development 

[2:6:68,136] Juvenile: Operations and Offender Programs; Academic and Vocational Education; Health Care Services

[11:0:58,449] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[12:0:68,465] • 

[13:0:78,468] Proposition 57 Implementation- Overall, the Budget includes net savings of $38.8 million. The savings reflect the 

[13:1:78,477] anticipated increase in the number of juvenile court commitments to the Division of Juvenile Justice, and the proposed 

[13:2:78,486] parole and credit earning changes that result in reductions to the adult inmate population and increases to the adult 

[13:3:78,495] parole population. The Budget includes $6.7 million General Fund to implement an expanded parole review process for 

[13:4:78,504] inmates convicted of a non-violent offense after they have served the full term of their primary offense, and to 

[13:5:78,513] implement changes to offender credit earning for good behavior and rehabilitative achievements. The requested 

[13:6:78,522] resources will fund additional case records staff to review and make various changes to inmate classification files 

[13:7:78,531] related to the new credit earning structure and parole process, parole workload due to additional releases from prison, 

[13:8:78,540] and Board of Parole Hearings workload for the increased number of inmates considered for release. 

[13:9:78,558] Video Surveillance Pilot Program-The Budget includes $11.7 million General Fund to implement a video surveillance 

[13:10:78,567] pilot program at High Desert State Prison and Central California Women's Facility, aimed at improving the prison 

[13:11:78,576] environment. 

[14:0:68,555] • 

[15:0:68,591] • 

[16:0:78,594] Drug and Contraband Interdiction-The Budget includes $6.7 million General Fund to add 42 canine teams to the 

[16:1:78,603] existing 28. These resources will enable the Department to establish two permanent canine teams at each institution 

[16:2:78,612] as a statewide drug and contraband interdiction strategy. 

[17:0:68,627] • 

[17:1:68,654] • 

[18:0:78,630] Roof Replacements-The Budget includes an increase of $34.9 million General Fund for roof replacements at the 

[18:1:78,639] California Correctional Institution, Pleasant Valley State Prison, and Salinas Valley State Prison. 

[18:2:78,657] Transfer of Intermediate and Acute Levels of Care-The Budget redirects $254.4 million General Fund and 1,977.6 

[18:3:78,666] positions from the Department of State Hospitals to reflect the transfer of the psychiatric programs from State Hospitals 

[18:4:78,675] to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to streamline operations. This transfer is effective July 1, 

[18:5:78,684] 2017. 

[19:0:68,699] • 

[20:0:78,702] Receiver: California Prison Industry Authority Janitorial Services Expansion-The Budget includes $6 million General 

[20:1:78,711] Fund in 2016-17 and $13.8 million General Fund beginning in 2017-18 to expand California Prison Industry Authority 

[20:2:78,720] janitorial services to space constructed through the Health Care Facility Improvement Program and Statewide 

[20:3:78,729] Medication Distribution improvements.

[2:0:68,80] • 

[3:0:78,82] Receiver: Health Care Appeals-The Budget includes $5.4 million General Fund to establish a new health care appeals 

[3:1:78,91] process based on a pilot program that was launched by the Receiver in September 2015. This process involves a 

[3:2:78,100] clinical review to better respond to medical issues when inmates file an appeal. 

[3:3:78,118] Receiver: Medication Management Staffing-The Budget includes $6.7 million General Fund to augment medication 

[3:4:78,127] management staffing at various institutions.

[6:0:78,145] Receiver: Health Care Assets Property Controllers-The Budget includes $2.1 million General Fund to provide dedicated 

[6:1:78,154] property controllers to track and service health care assets. These positions will track and schedule required 

[6:2:78,163] maintenance to ensure timely completion, monitor expiration dates on materials for reordering or redistribution, and 

[6:3:78,172] track all equipment to eliminate misplaced assets.

[8:0:78,190] Receiver: Suicide Watch Coverage-The Budget includes $3.1 million General Fund for additional nursing staff to 

[8:1:78,199] provide suicide watch coverage. The requested resources will provide additional staff at institutions with an Enhanced

[1:0:162,44] 5227 Board of State and Community Corrections 

[1:1:58,64] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and 

[1:2:58,73] technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal 

[1:3:58,82] justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 public safety 

[1:4:58,91] realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices, including prevention, 

[1:5:58,100] intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is 

[1:6:58,109] consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-

[1:7:58,118] based strategies for managing criminal justice populations. 

[2:0:58,136] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has 

[2:1:58,145] a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[3:0:68,98] • 

[4:0:78,100] State Penalty Fund Redistribution-Due to the continuing decline of revenues to the State Penalty Fund, the Budget 

[4:1:78,109] includes various solutions to address the insolvency of the Fund, including direct appropriations from the Fund for 

[4:2:78,118] certain departments. Specifically, the Budget includes a direct appropriation of $17.2 million from the State Penalty 

[4:3:78,127] Fund for the Standards and Training for Local Corrections program to maintain critical local law enforcement training 

[4:4:78,136] services. The Budget also eliminates $9.5 million Restitution Fund for the California Gang Reduction and Intervention 

[4:5:78,145] Program but includes a one-time $9.5 million General Fund augmentation to continue a modified and renamed

[10:0:213,485] 5420 Prison Industry Authority 

[10:1:58,506] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional 

[10:2:58,515] industries in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much 

[10:3:58,524] like a corporate board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California 

[10:4:58,533] Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General 

[10:5:58,542] Services or his or her designee, the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public 

[10:6:58,551] members appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, 

[10:7:58,560] and four members appointed by the Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his 

[10:8:58,569] or her designee serves as chair of the Board. 

[11:0:58,587] The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good 

[11:1:58,596] work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA 

[11:2:58,605] work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming. 

[12:0:58,623] The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 

[12:1:58,632] provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within 

[12:2:58,641] enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work 

[12:3:58,650] productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work 

[12:4:58,659] programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and 

[12:5:58,668] services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the 

[12:6:58,677] costs of its operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
