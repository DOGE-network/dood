[5:0:66,282] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,302] 3835 - HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE  

[6:0:66,322] The Health Care Workforce Program, through the Health Care Workforce Development Division and the Health Professions  

[6:1:66,332] Education Foundation, improves access to medical, mental, and dental health care providers in underserved areas throughout  

[6:2:66,342] California. The Program conducts research to identify areas of unmet need and administers grants that provide financial  

[6:3:66,353] incentives to individuals and institutions to increase the number of providers in those areas. The Program promotes health care  

[6:4:66,363] workforce diversity and cultural competency. It includes the following programs:  

[6:5:65,380] • Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Program  

[7:0:65,397] • Mental Health Services Act Workforce Education and Training Program  

[7:1:65,413] • California State Loan Repayment Program  

[7:2:65,429] • Health Care Workforce Clearinghouse Program  

[7:3:65,445] • Health Professions Career Opportunity Training Program  

[7:4:65,461] • Health Workforce Pilot Projects Program  

[7:5:65,478] • Shortage Designation Program  

[8:0:65,494] • Health Professions Education Foundation Programs  

[8:1:66,512] 3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT  

[9:0:66,529] The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and  

[9:1:66,539] construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of  

[9:2:66,550] providing sustained services to the public.  

[9:3:66,567] 3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE  

[10:0:66,585] The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and  

[10:1:66,595] nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors  

[10:2:66,605] the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating  

[10:3:66,616] access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California.  

[10:4:66,633] 3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 

[11:0:66,651] The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from  

[11:1:66,661] approximately 6,000 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment  

[11:2:66,671] data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory  

[11:3:66,682] surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers,  

[11:4:66,692] health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this  

[11:5:66,702] mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and  

[12:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[8:0:228,404] 4170   Department of Aging  

[9:0:66,426] The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, and  

[9:1:66,436] families through:  

[9:2:65,454] • Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives,  

[9:3:65,470] • Opportunities for community involvement,  

[9:4:65,486] • Support to family members providing care, and  

[9:5:65,502] • Collaboration with other state and local agencies.  

[9:6:66,520] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that  

[9:7:66,530] provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and  

[9:8:66,540] Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate  

[9:9:66,551] the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-

[9:10:66,561] Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid.  

[10:0:66,581] The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the  

[10:1:66,591] local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults  

[10:2:66,602] with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

[9:2:66,505] legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term  

[9:3:66,515] Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support  

[9:4:66,526] necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care  

[9:5:66,536] services appropriate to their needs.  

[10:0:66,553] 3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS  

[11:0:66,571] This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides  

[11:1:66,581] personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local  

[11:2:66,592] source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans.  

[11:3:66,609] 3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS  

[12:0:66,627] This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services  

[12:1:66,637] (CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age or over who  

[12:2:66,647] are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or disabilities. The  

[12:3:66,658] Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-

[12:4:66,668] based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term  

[12:5:66,678] care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

[0:0:66,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[1:0:412,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — HHS   51 

[2:0:134,29] 4260   State Department of Health Care Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,93] California Code of Regulations, Titles 9, 17 and 22.  

[4:0:66,130] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[5:0:65,149] • COVID-19 Estimate Impacts—The Budget includes costs of $8.1 billion total funds and savings of $155.1 million General  

[5:1:76,160] Fund for COVID-19 impacts on the Medi-Cal program. Costs are primarily attributable to a significant increase in caseload  

[5:2:76,170] associated with projected unemployment and the Medi-Cal response to COVID-19, offset by an assumed increase in the  

[5:3:76,180] Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). Specifically, the Budget assumes that caseload will peak at 14.5 million in  

[5:4:76,190] July 2020, or about 2.0 million above what caseload would have been absent the COVID-19 pandemic. 

[6:0:65,206] • Suspensions—In addition to suspensions included in the 2019 Budget Act, the Budget   suspends all Proposition 56 programs  

[6:1:76,217] other than women’s health, family planning, and the Loan Repayment Program on July 1, 2021. The suspension will be lifted  

[6:2:76,227] if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to  

[6:3:76,237] support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal years. 

[7:0:65,253] • Nursing Facility Financing—The Budget includes $185.6 million ($92.8 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to extend through  

[7:1:76,263] December 1, 2022 the financing system for skilled nursing facilities, originally established pursuant to Chapter 875, Statutes  

[7:2:76,274] of 2004 (AB 1629). In addition, the Budget includes a 10-percent rate increase for SNFs assumed to be in effect for four  

[7:3:76,284] months during the COVID-19 emergency, at a General Fund cost of $72.4 million in 2019-20 and $41.6 million in 2020-21.  

[8:0:65,300] • 340B Supplemental Payment Pool—The Budget includes $52.5 million ($26.3 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to provide  

[8:1:76,310] supplemental payments to specified non-hospital clinics who participated in the federal 340B pharmacy program. These  

[8:2:76,320] payments grow to $105 million ($52.5 million General Fund) in 2021-22 and annually thereafter.  

[9:0:65,337] • Managed Care Efficiencies—The Budget implements changes to the way that managed care capitation rates are  

[9:1:76,347] determined. These changes include various acuity, efficiency, and cost containment adjustments. These adjustments would  

[9:2:76,357] be effective for the managed care rate year starting January 1, 2021, and would yield savings of $193.6 million ($63 million  

[9:3:76,367] General Fund) in 2020-21. Additionally, the Budget assumes a 1.5 percent rate reduction for the July 1, 2019, through  

[9:4:76,377] December 31, 2020, period, resulting in savings of $586 million ($182 million General Fund) in 2020-21. The Budget does  

[9:5:76,388] not implement a maximum fee schedule for inpatient services in the managed care program.  

[10:0:65,404] • Hearing Aids Grant Program—The Budget includes $352,000 General Fund in 2020-21 to administer and establish a  

[10:1:76,414] program to assist with the cost of hearing aids and related services for children without health insurance coverage in  

[10:2:76,424] households with incomes up to 600 percent of the federal poverty level, no sooner than July 1, 2021. The Budget assumes  

[10:3:76,434] ongoing costs of approximately $15 million General Fund to provide and administer this benefit. 

[11:0:65,451] • Managed Care Organization Tax—The Budget includes $1.7 billion in General Fund savings associated with the federal  

[11:1:76,461] government’s approval of a three-year managed care organization (MCO) provider tax. The MCO tax is estimated to result in  

[11:2:76,471] approximately $4.9 billion in General Fund savings over the full three years of the tax.

[6:0:207,213] 4265   Department of Public Health  

[7:0:66,234] The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all  

[7:1:66,245] Californians through the following core activities:  

[7:2:65,262] • Protecting the public from communicable diseases.  

[8:0:65,279] • Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments, and improving social determinants of health and healthy  

[8:1:76,289] communities.  

[9:0:65,305] • Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities by embedding health and  

[9:1:76,315] mental health equity language, tools, and approaches into all public health and partner agency policies, programs, systems,  

[9:2:76,325] and resource allocation.  

[9:3:65,342] • Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.  

[10:0:65,358] • Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to  

[10:1:76,368] guide public health strategies, programs, and actions.  

[10:2:65,384] • Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces.  

[10:3:65,400] • Providing access to quality, population-based health services.  

[11:0:66,418] Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[11:1:66,428] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:176,213] 4300   Department of Developmental Services  

[7:0:66,235] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for  

[7:1:66,245] providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and  

[7:2:66,255] productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides  

[7:3:66,265] leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the  

[7:4:66,276] developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems  

[7:5:66,286] that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies  

[7:6:66,296] known as regional centers as well as through a developmental center and a state-operated community facility. The Department,  

[7:7:66,306] through the 21 regional centers, oversees coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities; provides that  

[7:8:66,316] such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to  

[7:9:66,327] the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community.  

[8:0:66,344] Because the Department of Developmental Services' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has  

[8:1:66,355] a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[9:0:66,242] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[10:0:65,262] • Supplemental Rate Increases for Additional Service Codes—The Budget includes $18 million ($10.8 million General Fund) in  

[10:1:76,272] 2020-21 and 2021-22 to provide supplemental rate increases for Early Start Specialized Therapeutic Services, Infant  

[10:2:76,282] Development and Independent Living Services. This approach is consistent with the supplemental rate increases included in  

[10:3:76,292] the 2019 Budget Act. The increased funding for the three services will be suspended on December 31, 2021. The  

[10:4:76,302] suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General  

[10:5:76,313] Fund revenue to support all suspended programs.  

[11:0:65,329] • Uniform Holiday Schedule—The Budget includes $51.5 million ($31.3 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to suspend  

[11:1:76,339] implementation of the Uniform Holiday Schedule. The funding will be suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will  

[11:2:76,349] be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue  

[11:3:76,359] to support all suspended programs.  

[12:0:65,376] • COVID-19 Impacts—The Budget includes $336.7 million ($237.5 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to reflect impacts of  

[12:1:76,386] COVID-19 on the developmental services system. These changes reflect increased costs associated with increased  

[12:2:76,396] utilization in purchase of services specific to residential settings, respite, and personal attendants. These costs also reflect  

[12:3:76,406] surge development at the developmental centers and in the community.  

[13:0:65,422] • Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST) Capacity—The Budget includes $16.4 million General Fund in 2020-21 to activate a 20-bed  

[13:1:76,433] unit at Porterville Developmental Center (PDC) and develop five enhanced behavioral support homes to increase capacity  

[13:2:76,443] for IST placements and secure community resources for individuals at PDC. The increased funding for the 20-bed unit PDC  

[13:3:76,453] will sunset on June 30, 2023.  

[14:0:65,469] • Fairview Developmental Center Warm-Shutdown—The Budget includes $11.9 million General Fund to extend the warm-

[14:1:76,479] shutdown period at Fairview Developmental Center through 2020-21 until a site assessment is completed to inform the  

[14:2:76,490] disposition of the property.

[1:0:419,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:141,29] 4300   Department of Developmental Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] for   individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial due to their developmental disability. The Department is  

[3:1:66,93] projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences by the   fall of 2020 in  

[3:2:66,103] Northern, Central, and Southern California   to provide acute crisis services in the community.   The Department also leases one  

[3:3:66,113] small community facility for persons who require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed facility in  

[3:4:66,124] Cathedral City (Riverside County).  

[4:0:66,141] All   residential facilities are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for skilled nursing care and intermediate  

[4:1:66,152] care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility, and STAR residences operate as community crisis homes.  

[4:2:66,162] Services at all facilities involve the provision of active treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis,  

[4:3:66,172] including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and assistance with activities of daily living,  

[4:4:66,182] training, education, and employment.  

[5:0:66,200] Individuals served in the STAR crisis   residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and  

[5:1:66,210] habilitation services during a crisis, and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their  

[5:2:66,220] residential home or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program   is to provide a safety net of  

[5:3:66,230] services that include providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed  

[5:4:66,241] need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and  

[5:5:66,251] least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system; and are designed to teach  

[5:6:66,261] individuals the skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance  

[5:7:66,271] personal competence in all areas of daily living.  

[6:0:66,289] Fairview Developmental Center and the non-secure treatment portion of Porterville Developmental Center transitioned the last  

[6:1:66,299] resident into a community setting in December 2019.  

[6:2:66,317] 4149 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION  

[7:0:66,337] The objective of this program is to: (1) provide overall management, planning and policy development, legal, legislative, audit,  

[7:1:66,347] and administrative services; (2) manage revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state programs, insurance  

[7:2:66,358] companies, and private payers for the cost of services; (3) monitor regional center operations for compliance with statute,  

[7:3:66,368] regulations, and their contract with the Department; (4) provide central administrative and clinical management services to  

[7:4:66,378] the   two residential facilities and the leased small community facility to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with

[4:0:66,102] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facilities under its control,  

[4:1:66,113] including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities  

[4:2:66,123] are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County.  

[4:3:66,140] The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet in 319   buildings on 784 acres.   As of  

[4:4:66,151] December 2019, the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former  

[4:5:66,161] residents to community living.   The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until  

[4:6:66,171] disposition of the property.   The Department also operates two residences and is developing five more for Stabilization,  

[4:7:66,181] Training, Assistance, and Reintegration programs that provide acute crisis services in the community.   Additionally, the  

[4:8:66,191] Department is responsible for the maintenance of interior finishes and equipment at a 57,000 square foot leased facility in

[15:1:66,387] full service law enforcement agency that protects the safety and security of the state hospital facilities, staff and patients. DSH  

[15:2:66,397] provides training standards, model programs, cultural competency, program development, and a comprehensive training plan  

[15:3:66,407] to all protective services staff. The HPO Academy requires that cadets successfully complete 548 hours of multidisciplinary  

[15:4:66,418] training specific to the DSH police officer job specifications.  

[16:0:66,435] 4420 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,456] The Conditional Release Program is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients.  

[17:1:66,466] Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began operations on  

[17:2:66,476] January 1, 1986.  

[18:0:66,494] 4420010 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM  

[19:0:66,512] The Conditional Release Program General/Non-Sexually Violent Predators is comprised of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity,  

[19:1:66,522] Mentally Disordered Offender, felony Incompetent to Stand Trial, and Mentally Disordered Sex Offender patients. Individuals  

[19:2:66,532] suitable for this program may be recommended by the state hospital medical director to the courts for outpatient treatment.

[19:4:66,552] non-SVP commitments.  

[20:0:66,570] 4420020 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM -   SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS

[21:1:66,598] 1, 1996 per Welfare and Institutions Code 6604. Prior to the conditional release of the first sexual violent predator in  

[21:2:66,608] 2003,   conditional release providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators  

[21:3:66,618] as patients, requiring the Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving  

[21:4:66,629] 58 counties. Current statue requires the sexually violent predators be conditionally released to their county of domicile and  

[21:5:66,639] sufficient funding be available to provide treatment and supervision services when a sexually violent predator is conditionally  

[21:6:66,649] released into the community by court order.

[1:0:419,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:166,29] 4440   Department of State Hospitals - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] 4430010 - ADMISSION, EVALUATION, STABILIZATION CENTER 

[4:0:66,101] The Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County Jail receives incompetent to stand trial patients  

[4:1:66,111] committed to the Department of State Hospitals directly from catchment counties in southern California. Patients receive a full  

[4:2:66,121] evaluation upon admission to determine whether they can be treated through the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization  

[4:3:66,131] Center on a short-term basis or may need longer-term state hospital treatment. Patients considered to be short-term can be  

[4:4:66,141] treated and discharged directly from the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center.  

[4:5:66,159] 4430020 - JAIL-BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT  

[5:0:66,177] The Jail-Based Competency Treatment Program focuses on defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial and provides  

[5:1:66,187] mental health treatment to defendants in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court  

[5:2:66,197] proceedings.  

[6:0:66,215] 4440 - EVALUATION AND FORENSIC SERVICES  

[7:0:66,233] Evaluation and Forensic Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender and the Sex Offender Commitment  

[7:1:66,243] Programs. Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of  

[7:2:66,253] Parole Hearings to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs  

[7:3:66,263] evaluations to determine if individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the Mentally Disordered Offender program. These  

[7:4:66,273] evaluations are used by the Board of Parole Hearings in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of  

[7:5:66,284] State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995)  

[7:6:66,294] was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to  

[7:7:66,304] be sexually violent predators. The Sex Offender Commitment Program administers clinical screenings and performs  

[7:8:66,314] evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for a sexually violent predator commitment to the

[3:0:66,83] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,102] 4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS  

[4:0:66,123] The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through  

[4:1:66,133] financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services.  

[5:0:66,153] The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households  

[5:1:66,164] to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related  

[5:2:66,174] emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard  

[5:3:66,184] the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which  

[5:4:66,194] supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used  

[5:5:66,204] along with LIHEAP weatherization related services.  

[6:0:66,225] The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-

[6:1:66,235] income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants.  

[7:0:66,253] The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides weatherization and renewable energy services in low-income  

[7:1:66,263] single-family and multi-family dwellings within disadvantaged communities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LIWP  

[7:2:66,273] includes projects such as weatherization and solar water heater and solar photovoltaic systems installations.  

[7:3:66,291] 4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES  

[8:0:66,311] The Community Services Block Grant is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community organizations to  

[8:1:66,321] help low-income families achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through a broad range of activities. These activities include  

[8:2:66,332] education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional  

[8:3:66,342] services. Additionally, Community Services Block Grant funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-

[8:4:66,352] income communities.  

[9:0:66,370] The California Earned Income Tax Credit (Cal EITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax  

[9:1:66,380] credits to boost the income of eligible families.   Since 2017-18   CSD has worked with the Franchise Tax Board and non-profit  

[9:2:66,390] and community-based organizations to increase awareness of the Cal EITC and provide free tax preparation assistance to  

[9:3:66,400] Californians.

[2:0:170,29] 5160   Department of Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,72] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES  

[5:0:66,90] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities through  

[5:1:66,100] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that persons with disabilities  

[5:2:66,110] may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In addition, the  

[5:3:66,121] Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education, mental  

[5:4:66,131] health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process,  

[5:5:66,141] which gives priority to persons with the most significant disabilities.  

[6:0:66,159] Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of  

[6:1:66,169] services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, supported  

[6:2:66,179] employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their  

[6:3:66,189] communities. The Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals  

[6:4:66,200] working in non-competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment.  

[7:0:66,217] The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and  

[7:1:66,227] auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16  

[7:2:66,238] through 21 (or upon matriculation from high school, whichever is later), including many who may benefit from early career  

[7:3:66,248] development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary  

[7:4:66,258] education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy. 

[8:0:66,276] The Department provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to enable persons who are blind or visually  

[8:1:66,286] impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational, including  

[8:2:66,296] employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to consumers with vision loss to prepare  

[8:3:66,306] them for vocational rehabilitation services and independent living.  

[9:0:66,324] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation  

[9:1:66,334] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and  

[9:2:66,344] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.  

[10:0:66,362] The Department works with the federal government to administer the California Career Innovations Demonstration Project to  

[10:1:66,372] identify how to increase the self-sufficiency of students with disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and  

[10:2:66,383] planned education to prepare them for workplace success.  

[11:0:66,400] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES  

[12:0:66,418] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout  

[12:1:66,428] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently   with full  

[12:2:66,438] inclusion   in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems  

[12:3:66,449] change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion  

[12:4:66,459] services to community based living, and   transition services to postsecondary life for youth.  

[13:0:66,476] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their  

[13:1:66,487] families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with  

[13:2:66,497] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for  

[13:3:66,507] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to  

[13:4:66,517] administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a  

[13:5:66,527] statewide TBI registry, needs assessment, and resource plan.  

[14:0:66,545] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 17 non-profit community-based  

[14:1:66,555] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually  

[14:2:66,566] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low  

[14:3:66,576] vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, independent living  

[14:4:66,586] skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.  

[15:0:66,604] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[16:0:66,621] The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services  

[16:1:66,632] to departmental programs.

[9:2:66,385] more children. This change is anticipated to result in an additional $34 million annually passed-through to approximately  

[9:3:66,395] 160,000 CalWORKs families. The Budget includes $800,000 ($300,000 General Fund) in 2020-21 for the necessary

[10:0:66,423] The Budget includes   an ongoing   $46.4 million   General Fund reduction   for child support administration, that will be  

[10:1:66,434] restored,   should federal funds   become available by October 15,   2020. This reduction includes:

[7:1:66,380] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The  

[7:2:66,391] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.  

[7:3:66,408] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:  

[8:0:66,426] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal  

[8:1:66,436] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State  

[8:2:66,446] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts  

[8:3:66,457] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support  

[8:4:66,467] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments  

[8:5:66,477] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program  

[8:6:66,487] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[15:0:66,573] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[15:1:65,593] • Child Support Payments—The Budget increases the amount of child support payments passed through to CalWORKs  

[15:2:76,603] families, effective January 1, 2022, from the current $50 to $100 for a family with one child and $200 for a family with two or  

[15:3:76,613] more children. This change is anticipated to result in an additional $34 million annually passed-through to approximately  

[15:4:76,623] 160,000 CalWORKs families, and reduce annual General Fund revenues by $17 million. The Budget includes $0.6 million  

[15:5:76,633] General Fund for the necessary automation changes needed to implement the proposal in 2021-22.  

[16:0:65,650] • CalFresh Application Assistance—The Budget includes $5 million General Fund annually to maintain the GetCalFresh.org

[1:0:407,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — HHS   179 

[2:0:166,29] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,72] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS  

[5:0:66,93] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support  

[5:1:66,103] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components:  

[6:0:65,121] • California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)  

[7:0:65,137] • Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food  

[7:1:76,147] Assistance Programs  

[8:0:65,163] • Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program  

[9:0:65,179] • County Administration and Automation Projects  

[10:0:65,196] • Disaster Relief  

[11:0:66,224] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to  

[11:1:66,234] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,  

[11:2:66,244] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.  

[12:0:66,262] 4270010 - CalWORKs:  

[13:0:66,279] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is  

[13:1:66,290] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic  

[13:2:66,300] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes  

[13:3:66,310] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet  

[13:4:66,320] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs  

[13:5:66,330] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the  

[13:6:66,341] Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by the California Department of Education. Parents  

[13:7:66,351] have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs  

[13:8:66,361] families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and  

[13:9:66,371] development services.  

[14:0:66,389] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:  

[15:0:66,407] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term  

[15:1:66,417] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as  

[15:2:66,427] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is  

[15:3:66,437] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social  

[15:4:66,447] Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to  

[15:5:66,458] relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system.  

[16:0:66,475] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate  

[16:1:66,485] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in  

[16:2:66,496] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and  

[16:3:66,506] state law.  

[17:0:66,524] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:  

[18:0:65,541] • The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States  

[18:1:76,551] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.  

[19:0:65,569] • The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and  

[19:1:76,579] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States  

[19:2:76,590] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the  

[19:3:76,600] minor.  

[20:0:65,617] • The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human  

[20:1:76,628] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are  

[20:2:76,638] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under  

[20:3:76,648] CalWORKs).  

[21:0:66,666] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of  

[21:1:66,676] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of  

[21:2:66,686] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations  

[21:3:66,696] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits  

[21:4:66,707] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:419,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:166,29] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in  

[3:1:66,93] employment and training activities.  

[4:0:66,111] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution  

[4:1:66,121] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for  

[4:2:66,131] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with  

[4:3:66,141] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a  

[4:4:66,152] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.  

[5:0:66,169] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious  

[5:1:66,179] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity  

[5:2:66,190] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services  

[5:3:66,200] on October 1, 2016.  

[6:0:66,218] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:  

[7:0:66,235] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled  

[7:1:66,245] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a  

[7:2:66,256] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who  

[7:3:66,266] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.  

[8:0:66,284] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:  

[9:0:66,301] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who  

[9:1:66,311] administer public assistance programs.  

[10:0:66,329] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.  

[11:0:66,347] 4270046 - Disaster Relief:  

[12:0:66,357] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have  

[12:1:66,367] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance  

[12:2:66,377] programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select  

[12:3:66,388] recovery grants.  

[13:0:66,405] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING  

[14:0:66,423] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child  

[14:1:66,433] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and  

[14:2:66,443] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of  

[14:3:66,454] the service delivery system.  

[15:0:66,471] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:  

[16:0:66,489] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in  

[16:1:66,499] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who  

[16:2:66,509] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs  

[16:3:66,520] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,  

[16:4:66,530] and IHSS-Residual Program.  

[17:0:66,548] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:  

[18:0:66,558] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse  

[18:1:66,568] Prevention.  

[19:0:66,588] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and  

[19:1:66,599] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated  

[19:2:66,609] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with  

[19:3:66,619] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and  

[19:4:66,629] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from  

[19:5:66,639] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.  

[20:0:66,660] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter  

[20:1:66,670] 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to change  

[20:2:66,680] out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment and case  

[20:3:66,690] planning.  

[21:0:66,711] The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:1:66,93] children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services  

[3:2:66,103] include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents;  

[3:3:66,113] training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For  

[3:4:66,124] independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the  

[3:5:66,134] biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.  

[4:0:66,154] The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and  

[4:1:66,164] sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and  

[4:2:66,175] services for at risk families and their children.  

[5:0:66,195] The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of abuse, neglect, or financial  

[5:1:66,205] exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary.

[6:1:66,236] and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes  

[6:2:66,246] facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components.

[7:3:66,320] 4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER  

[8:0:66,337] The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project provides  

[8:1:66,347] participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state foster care  

[8:2:66,358] maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable.  

[8:3:66,375] 4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES  

[9:0:66,393] The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and

[10:1:66,449] applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of  

[10:2:66,459] the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and  

[10:3:66,469] overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.  

[10:4:66,487] 4285019 - Services to Other Agencies:  

[11:0:66,497] In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative  

[11:1:66,507] services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human  

[11:2:66,518] Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public  

[11:3:66,528] information services.  

[11:4:66,545] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[12:0:66,563] The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and

[8:0:66,503] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:1:65,523] • The Budget includes $750 million General Fund in 2020-21 to provide support for counties experiencing revenue losses for  

[8:2:76,533] realigned programs. In utilizing these funds, counties will prioritize support for health and human services, entitlement  

[8:3:76,543] programs, and programs that serve vulnerable populations. This funding is not reflected in this document. To the extent the  

[8:4:76,553] federal government provides sufficient eligible funding by October 15, 2020, an additional $250 million may be provided to  

[8:5:76,563] counties for the aforementioned purposes.

[3:0:66,53] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,72] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT  

[4:0:66,93] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve  

[4:1:66,103] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability  

[4:2:66,113] for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage  

[4:3:66,123] cost-effective approaches to providing services.  

[5:0:66,144] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[5:1:66,154] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts  

[5:2:66,164] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified  

[5:3:66,174] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to  

[5:4:66,185] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision  

[5:5:66,195] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for  

[5:6:66,205] county health and social services programs.

[3:0:66,83] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is  

[3:1:66,93] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and  

[3:2:66,103] technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at  

[3:3:66,113] less cost.  

[3:4:66,134] The funding sources for realignment are:  

[3:5:65,152] • The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.  

[3:6:65,168] • The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[4:0:66,196] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:  

[4:1:65,213] • Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services)  

[4:2:65,230] • Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care;  

[4:3:76,240] Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment)  

[4:4:65,256] • Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs)  

[4:5:65,272] • Trial Court Security Subaccount  

[5:0:65,288] • Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and  

[5:1:76,299] Adult Parole)  

[5:2:65,315] • Community Corrections Subaccount  

[5:3:65,331] • District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount  

[6:0:65,347] • Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant  

[6:1:76,357] Special Account)  

[7:0:66,385] The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on  

[7:1:66,395] statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures.  

[7:2:66,416] Note the $4.4 billion in   2019-20 and $4.5 billion in 2020-21 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety  

[7:3:66,426] programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full
