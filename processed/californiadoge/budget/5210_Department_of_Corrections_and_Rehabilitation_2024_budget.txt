[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 4500 - CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION  

[5:0:66,101] The objective of the Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration program is to provide policy direction, accountability,  

[5:1:66,111] administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult correctional and rehabilitation programs. The program  

[5:2:66,121] consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs; Audits and  

[5:3:66,130] Court Compliance; Victim and Survivor Rights and Services; Support Services; Enterprise Information Services; Labor  

[5:4:66,140] Relations; Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; Appeals; and the Office of the  

[5:5:66,150] Ombudsman.  

[6:0:66,167] 4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT  

[7:0:66,184] The Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development program is responsible for planning, organizing, analyzing, and  

[7:1:66,194] managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/ 

[7:2:66,204] psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training and employee development for all  

[7:3:66,214] departmental staff.  

[8:0:66,231] 4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES  

[9:0:66,248] The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services  

[9:1:66,258] provided by the Department of Justice to CDCR.  

[10:0:66,275] 4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS  

[11:0:66,293] The Department previously accepted commitments from California courts when the person to be committed met age  

[11:1:66,302] requirements, could materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there were adequate facilities available to care for the  

[11:2:66,312] individual.  

[12:0:66,329] The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program was to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and  

[12:1:66,339] perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility  

[12:2:66,349] operations. In addition, this program provided staff training, incarcerated youth intake and court services, population  

[12:3:66,359] management services, facility maintenance, and maintained incarcerated youth master files. This program oversaw operations  

[12:4:66,369] for three facilities and one conservation camp.  

[13:0:66,386] Treatment programs began with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post  

[13:1:66,396] release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based  

[13:2:66,405] treatment programs were recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption  

[13:3:66,415] therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp  

[13:4:66,425] programs, and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs were designed to promote positive social  

[13:5:66,435] behavior and reduce recidivism and relapse.  

[14:0:66,452] This program concluded operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on  

[14:1:66,462] June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92).  

[15:0:66,489] 4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION  

[16:0:66,506] The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operated as a local education agency known as the  

[16:1:66,516] California Education Authority. Its mission was to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and  

[16:2:66,526] knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release.  

[17:0:66,543] The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs were accredited by the Western Association of Schools and  

[17:1:66,553] Colleges and included core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development  

[17:2:66,562] preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students were required to meet the California Common  

[17:3:66,572] Core State Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services included special  

[17:4:66,582] education, English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high  

[17:5:66,592] school credit for work experience.  

[18:0:66,609] This program is concluded operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on  

[18:1:66,619] June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92).  

[19:0:66,636] 4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES  

[20:0:66,653] The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program was to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent  

[20:1:66,663] with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strove to achieve this  

[20:2:66,673] mission by providing cost-effective, timely, and competent care. In addition, Juvenile Health Care Services was responsible for  

[20:3:66,683] overseeing and implementing the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, which used evidence-based principles of a cognitive  

[20:4:66,692] behavioral treatment program to guide the development of the best program for the unique needs of the youth and young adult  

[20:5:66,702] population.

[2:0:122,32] 5225   Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] This program concluded operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on  

[3:1:66,78] June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92).  

[4:0:66,96] 4530 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - GENERAL SECURITY  

[5:0:66,113] CDCR is required by statute to accept convicted felons from California courts when their sentence is imprisonment in a state  

[5:1:66,123] correctional facility. The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - General Security program is to  

[5:2:66,132] provide safe and secure detention facilities to protect public safety. This program consists of 32 correctional institutions, 3 of  

[5:3:66,142] which have reception centers, and 35 conservation camps. This program also identifies custody overtime expenditures  

[5:4:66,152] associated with housing, guarding, and transporting incarcerated people.  

[6:0:66,169] 4540 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INMATE SUPPORT  

[7:0:66,186] The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Inmate Support program is to provide necessary services  

[7:1:66,196] to incarcerated people such as feeding, clothing, record keeping, and classification assessments at 32 correctional institutions,  

[7:2:66,206] 3 of which have reception centers, and 35 conservation camps. The camps perform public conservation projects including, but  

[7:3:66,216] not limited to, forest fire prevention, watershed management, and soil conservation.  

[8:0:66,233] 4550 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INSTITUTION ADMINISTRATION  

[9:0:66,250] The Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Institution Administration program is responsible for the management  

[9:1:66,260] and operation of 32 adult institutions, 3 of which have reception centers, and 35 conservation camps. The program is  

[9:2:66,270] responsible for improving institution programming and operations. This program is also responsible for providing facility  

[9:3:66,280] maintenance, asset management, and construction services for CDCR's adult facilities and other closed properties. In addition,  

[9:4:66,289] the Office of Correctional Safety facilitates institution and public safety via security threat group management, escapee  

[9:5:66,299] apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response training.  

[10:0:66,316] 4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION  

[11:0:66,334] The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and  

[11:1:66,344] degree of successful reintegration of incarcerated individuals released from state prison into the community. The program is  

[11:2:66,353] responsible for providing direct supervision and Global Positioning System (GPS) surveillance of the state’s parolee population.  

[11:3:66,363] It is also responsible for the location and apprehension of parolees who have absconded or when certain case factors exist.  

[11:4:66,373] The Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies utilize the California Parole Supervision and Reintegration  

[11:5:66,383] Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices to elicit long-term behavioral changes to reduce recidivism. Standard and  

[11:6:66,392] specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the incarcerated person's risk  

[11:7:66,402] factors and current mental health needs. Case Supervision level, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly scheduled  

[11:8:66,412] based on parolee behavior and stability in the community. Other components of supervision include the Sex Offender  

[11:9:66,422] Management Program, which incorporates the containment model strategy and GPS monitoring for all sex offenders as  

[11:10:66,431] required by statute.  

[12:0:66,449] Another integral aspect of this program is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and  

[12:1:66,459] services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support  

[12:2:66,468] successful transition from incarceration to the community.  

[13:0:66,486] 4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS  

[14:0:66,503] Rehabilitative Programs and Parole Operations - Adult Community Based Programs utilize a variety of rehabilitative and  

[14:1:66,513] reentry assistance programs designed to promote successful reintegration of parolees into their communities and reduce  

[14:2:66,522] recidivism. These programs include, but are not limited to, referrals, supportive reentry services and linkages to Transitional  

[14:3:66,532] Housing, the Long-Term Offender Reentry and Recovery Program, community-based coalitions, Parolee Service Centers, and  

[14:4:66,542] Day Reporting Centers. Other services include enrollment into Pre-Employment and Transitional Work Programs, Cognitive  

[14:5:66,552] Behavioral Treatment and interventions, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, and other wraparound services. The program  

[14:6:66,561] includes a full continuum of transitional programs, including the Transitional Case Management Program and sex offender  

[14:7:66,571] treatment for all sex offenders on parole.  

[15:0:66,589] The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's community-based Behavioral  

[15:1:66,598] Health Reintegration program, which provides transitional mental health treatment, case management, and crisis intervention.  

[15:2:66,608] The objective of these services is to reduce gaps in treatment after release from incarceration pending sustainable connection  

[15:3:66,618] to alternative service providers and necessary resources in the community.  

[16:0:66,635] 4565 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,652] Parole Operations - Adult Administration provides administration and support functions such as business services, contracts,  

[17:1:66,662] budgeting, and personnel for all programs and staff. The program also includes the leasing of office space, internet/data  

[17:2:66,672] infrastructure, and utilities for the parole units throughout the state. The Office of Correctional Safety, independent of the  

[17:3:66,682] Division of Adult Parole Operations, investigates and apprehends fugitive parolees suspected of committing serious or violent  

[17:4:66,692] crimes.

[10:0:164,530] 5227   Board of State and Community Corrections  

[11:0:66,551] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and technical  

[11:1:66,561] assistance necessary to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships within California's adult and juvenile criminal  

[11:2:66,571] justice systems, and to promote legal and safe conditions for youth, the incarcerated, and staff in local detention facilities. This  

[11:3:66,580] mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, intervention, suppression,  

[11:4:66,590] and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with the integrated  

[11:5:66,600] statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for managing  

[11:6:66,610] criminal justice populations. The Board seeks to ensure that its efforts are systematically informed by experts and stakeholders  

[11:7:66,620] with subject matter expertise.  

[12:0:66,637] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a  

[12:1:66,647] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[12:2:66,656] Overview."

[5:0:215,261] 5420   Prison Industry Authority  

[6:0:66,282] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries  

[6:1:66,292] in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate  

[6:2:66,302] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections  

[6:3:66,311] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or their designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or their designee, the  

[7:0:66,321] Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or their designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker of the  

[7:1:66,331] Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the Governor  

[7:2:66,341] representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or their designee serves as chair of the Board.  

[8:0:66,360] CALPIA supports CDCR’s public safety mission by providing job training programs to incarcerated individuals. These programs  

[8:1:66,370] are to help the incarcerated individuals develop job skills, establish good work habits, and obtain basic education and job  

[8:2:66,380] support so when they return to their communities they can gain meaningful employment and be productive and successful.  

[8:3:66,390] CALPIA's number one goal is rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.  

[9:0:66,409] CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that  

[9:1:66,419] provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working  

[10:0:66,429] conditions within enterprises similar to those that prevail in private industry to assure incarcerated individuals assigned therein  

[10:1:66,438] the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and  

[10:2:66,448] (3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from  

[10:3:66,458] the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by CDCR.  

[10:4:66,468] CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
