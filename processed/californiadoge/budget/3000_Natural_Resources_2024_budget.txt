[1:0:242,39] 3100   Exposition Park  

[2:0:66,60] The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are  

[2:1:66,70] located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these  

[2:2:66,79] three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park.  

[3:0:66,97] The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park  

[3:1:66,106] usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of  

[3:2:66,116] the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve,  

[3:3:66,126] and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the  

[3:4:66,136] western United States.  

[4:0:66,153] Because   the Science Center's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the   Science Center   has a capital outlay  

[4:1:66,163] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[7:0:66,331] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:0:66,350] 2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER  

[9:0:66,370] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and  

[9:1:66,380] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops  

[9:2:66,389] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.  

[10:0:66,409] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological  

[10:1:66,419] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,  

[10:2:66,428] communications, and transportation, on land and in space.   Construction for the Science Center’s Air and Space Center, the  

[10:3:66,438] permanent home for the Space Shuttle Endeavour, began in March 2022 and is expected to be completed in spring 2025.  

[11:0:66,458] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The  

[11:1:66,468] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and  

[11:2:66,477] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a  

[11:3:66,487] Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The  

[11:4:66,497] school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards.  

[12:0:66,516] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those  

[12:1:66,526] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding  

[12:2:66,536] support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.  

[13:0:66,553] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT  

[14:0:66,573] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management  

[14:1:66,583] and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events,  

[14:2:66,592] and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is  

[14:3:66,602] responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of  

[14:4:66,612] park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park  

[14:5:66,622] Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in  

[14:6:66,631] addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood.  

[15:0:66,649] 2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM  

[16:0:66,666] The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the  

[16:1:66,676] Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of  

[16:2:66,686] African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African  

[16:3:66,695] American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear  

[16:4:66,705] campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility  

[16:5:66,715] in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public  

[17:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,68] programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture,  

[3:1:66,78] historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and  

[3:2:66,88] to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at  

[3:3:66,98] large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty  

[3:4:66,108] years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an  

[3:5:66,117] inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

[6:0:201,187] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy  

[7:0:66,208] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational  

[7:1:66,218] resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs  

[7:2:66,228] that acquire environmentally sensitive land; restoring the thousands of parcels it owns to improve stream environments, wildlife  

[7:3:66,238] habitats, forest health, and water quality; and providing grants to fund soil erosion prevention, watershed restoration, improve  

[7:4:66,247] forest health, and reduce wildfire risk on other public lands. The Conservancy balances these activities with programs to  

[7:5:66,257] improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by acquiring lakefront property,  

[7:6:66,267] constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.  

[8:0:66,284] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to  

[8:1:66,294] restore and protect the Basin's natural resources. The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the  

[8:2:66,304] Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed  

[8:3:66,313] to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[8:4:66,323] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects.  

[9:0:66,340] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program  

[9:1:66,350] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[9:0:66,418] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:1:66,437] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY  

[10:0:66,454] The Conservancy manages nearly 4,700 state-owned properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of  

[10:1:66,464] quarter-acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits,  

[10:2:66,473] and have significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple  

[10:3:66,483] benefits and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and  

[10:4:66,493] encroachments. Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental  

[10:5:66,503] role of the Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational  

[10:6:66,513] amenities, including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe.  

[11:0:66,530] The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to  

[11:1:66,540] more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a  

[11:2:66,549] wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also  

[11:3:66,559] increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire,  

[11:4:66,569] clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This  

[11:5:66,579] work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change.  

[12:0:66,596] The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site  

[12:1:66,606] improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating  

[12:2:66,615] public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake.  

[12:3:66,633] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  

[13:0:66,652] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing  

[13:1:66,662] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide  

[13:2:66,672] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds  

[13:3:66,682] such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.  

[13:4:66,699] In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting  

[13:5:66,709] urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[4:3:66,117] 1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local  

[4:4:66,127] governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[4:5:66,136] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

[1:0:454,13] NATURAL RESOURCES 

[2:0:171,32] 3480   Department of Conservation - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,  

[3:1:66,78] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and  

[3:2:66,88] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets; and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,  

[3:3:66,98] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about  

[3:4:66,108] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.  

[3:5:66,125] 2425 - GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[4:0:66,142] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as   much  

[4:1:66,152] as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and  

[4:2:66,162] environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of  

[4:3:66,171] hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for  

[4:4:66,181] program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries. 

[4:5:66,198] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION  

[5:0:66,216] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program  

[5:1:66,226] provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local  

[5:2:66,235] governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts  

[5:3:66,245] for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development  

[5:4:66,255] rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops  

[5:5:66,265] maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use  

[5:6:66,274] decisions.  

[6:0:66,292] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION  

[7:0:66,309] This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface  

[7:1:66,319] Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim  

[7:2:66,329] mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and  

[7:3:66,338] remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.  

[7:4:66,356] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD  

[8:0:66,373] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of  

[8:1:66,383] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine  

[8:2:66,392] Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans,  

[8:3:66,402] and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to  

[8:4:66,412] comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local  

[8:5:66,422] government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

[7:1:66,212] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency  

[7:2:66,222] response.  

[8:0:66,242] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing  

[8:1:66,251] diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention

[5:0:66,138] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,157] 2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL  

[7:0:66,174] The Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) protects life and property through the development and application of fire  

[7:1:66,184] prevention, engineering, education, enforcement, and regulations.  

[8:0:66,201] 2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal:  

[9:0:66,219] The Office of the State Fire Marshal is comprised of the following six divisions:  

[10:0:65,236] • Code Development and Analysis: The Code Development and Analysis division is responsible for the development and  

[10:1:76,246] adoption of codes relating to fire and life safety used statewide by architects, engineers, design professionals, and the local  

[10:2:76,256] fire and building authorities. This division fosters, promotes, and develops ways and means of protecting life and property  

[10:3:76,265] against fire in many ways, including the adoption and implementation of regulations for statewide application. This division  

[10:4:76,275] prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations and building standards for review and adoption into the California Code of  

[10:5:76,285] Regulations, titles 19 and 24. The division assists local fire departments, fire districts, and building departments with the  

[10:6:76,295] application of state laws and regulations. This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life safety  

[10:7:76,304] for relevancy, necessity, conflict, duplication, and overlap.  

[11:0:65,320] • Fire and Life Safety: The Fire and Life Safety division is responsible for applying laws and regulations related to fire  

[11:1:76,330] prevention and life safety in state-owned and state-occupied facilities. This is achieved through code compliance inspections  

[11:2:76,340] of new and existing buildings and plan review and construction inspections. The OSFM is responsible for fire and life safety  

[11:3:76,350] in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, conservation camps, courts, state  

[11:4:76,359] mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California State University and University of California campuses, and  

[11:5:76,369] California Agricultural Districts.  

[12:0:65,385] • Fire Engineering and Investigations: The Fire Engineering and Investigations division’s primary functions include licensing,  

[12:1:76,395] product approval, fire/explosion investigations, and illegal fireworks enforcement and disposal. The division is responsible for  

[12:2:76,404] 11 statewide programs, which include the Building Materials Listing; Portable Fire Extinguishers; Flame Retardant Chemicals  

[12:3:76,414] and Fabrics; Vapor Recovery; Automatic Fire Extinguishing Systems; Fire Safe Cigarettes; Licensing Enforcement and  

[12:4:76,424] Inspection; Lab Accreditation; Motion Picture and Entertainment; Arson and Bomb Investigation; and Fireworks Disposal.  

[12:5:76,434] This division also oversees the Arson and Bomb Unit, which has the responsibility to dispose of seized illegal fireworks and  

[12:6:76,443] conduct fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement.  

[13:0:65,459] • Pipeline Safety: The Pipeline Safety division ensures the safe construction, operation, and maintenance of approximately  

[13:1:76,469] 5,400 miles of intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel,  

[13:2:76,479] etc.), and Highly Volatile Liquids through populated urban areas, ecologically sensitive areas, and other high consequence  

[13:3:76,489] areas. Pipelines that fall under the Pipeline Safety division authority are pipelines that transport hazardous liquids between  

[13:4:76,498] facilities, such as offshore platforms, production fields, refineries, storage terminals, and marine terminals. This division is  

[13:5:76,508] additionally charged with implementing investigations for failures, explosions, and fires on intrastate pipelines, and assisting  

[13:6:76,518] on investigations for interstate pipelines. The Certified Unified Program Agencies program is responsible for ensuring the  

[13:7:76,528] implementation of the California Fire Code Hazardous Materials Management Plan/Hazardous Materials Inventory  

[13:8:76,537] Statement (HMMP/HMIS) and the Aboveground Petroleum Storage Act program elements. The HMMP/HMIS program ties in  

[13:9:76,547] closely with the Hazardous Release Response Plan and Inventory or Hazardous Materials Business Plan program. The  

[13:10:76,557] Firefighter Equipment and Foam program is tasked to monitor the use of Perfluoroalky and Polyfluoroalkyl substances  

[13:11:76,567] (PFAS) throughout the state at designated facilities, and issue waivers to refineries and terminals for fixed suppression  

[13:12:76,577] systems meeting identified criteria.  

[14:0:65,592] • State Fire Training: The State Fire Training division administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System  

[14:1:76,602] and the Fire Service Training and Education Program for federal, state, and local firefighters. The division oversees a  

[14:2:76,612] California Fire Academy System for over 65 training academies that represent a partnership with the fire departments,  

[14:3:76,622] community colleges, and the OSFM. State Fire Training administers a professional certification system for fire service  

[14:4:76,631] personnel and receives program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services.  

[15:0:65,647] • Wildfire Planning and Engineering: The Wildfire Planning and Engineering division will be transitioning into the new  

[15:1:76,657] Community Wildfire Preparedness and Mitigation Division established by the passage of Chapter 225, Statutes of 2021 (AB  

[15:2:76,667] 9). The division is responsible for various community-level fire prevention and preparedness programs including defensible  

[15:3:76,677] space, home hardening, fire planning, land use planning, utility fire mitigation, fire prevention grants, fire hazard mapping,  

[15:4:76,686] incident data and statistics, and damage inspection.

[3:0:66,68] Also called the “Dig Safe Board,” created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), the Board works on  

[3:1:66,78] issues related to the state's "Call Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators and buried infrastructure owners to coordinate  

[3:2:66,88] to prevent infrastructure damage and unsafe outcomes. The Dig Safe Board is charged with coordinating the state’s safe  

[3:3:66,98] excavation outreach and education efforts, developing safe excavation standards, investigating accidents and working with  

[3:4:66,108] partner state agencies to enforce the “Call Before You Dig” law. The Dig Safe Board was transferred to the Office of Energy  

[3:5:66,117] Infrastructure Safety on January 1, 2022 to comply with the requirements of Chapter 307, Statutes of 2020 (SB 865).  

[4:0:66,135] 2465 - FIRE PROTECTION  

[5:0:66,152] CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property, and natural resources within social, political, and economic  

[5:1:66,162] constraints. The objective is to attack fires quickly and aggressively in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct  

[5:2:66,171] protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract, or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and  

[5:3:66,181] follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires within the first  

[5:4:66,191] burning period.  

[6:0:66,208] 2465010 - Fire Prevention:  

[7:0:66,226] This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression  

[7:1:66,235] cost recovery, and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials, and procedures to  

[7:2:66,245] mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be  

[7:3:66,255] done before a wildland fire starts to reduce the costs of firefighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters, and  

[7:4:66,265] damage to the environment.  

[8:0:66,282] 2465019 - Fire Control:  

[9:0:66,299] The objective of this program is to detect, respond to, and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility  

[9:1:66,309] Area. The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to  

[9:2:66,319] ten acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack, and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews,  

[9:3:66,329] bulldozers, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft.  

[10:0:66,346] 2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection:  

[11:0:66,363] CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state, and federal agencies throughout California  

[11:1:66,373] through the administration of over 100 cooperative fire protection service agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing  

[11:2:66,383] agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department.  

[12:0:66,400] 2465037 - Conservation Camps:  

[13:0:66,417] CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Parole Operations and  

[13:1:66,427] Division of Juvenile Justice, operates 30 conservation camps throughout the state with capacity to house 152 fire crews. CAL  

[13:2:66,437] FIRE operates seven permanent Fire Centers, six seasonal Fire Centers, and one Parole Training Center with the California  

[13:3:66,446] Conservation Corps throughout the state that house 28 fire crews. CAL FIRE also operates in conjunction with the California  

[13:4:66,456] National Guard to staff seven Fire Centers with a total of 10 fire crews.   Additionally, CAL FIRE is currently authorized to  

[13:5:66,466] operate 16 CAL FIRE Firefighter Crews located at seven different Fire Centers. These crews are available to respond to all  

[13:6:66,476] types of emergencies including wildfires, floods, search and rescue, and earthquakes. When not responding to emergencies,  

[13:7:66,486] the crews engage in hazardous fuels reduction, conservation related work projects, and prescribed fire project work to protect  

[13:8:66,495] the community and resources of California.  

[14:0:66,513] 2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression:  

[15:0:66,530] CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope  

[15:1:66,540] with a wildland fire within the initial attack period.   Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was  

[15:2:66,549] incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management  

[15:3:66,559] Agency or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of this cost  

[15:4:66,569] through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes.  

[16:0:66,586] 2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  

[17:0:66,604] California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands, and urban forests provide multiple human, climate, and  

[17:1:66,613] environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to  

[17:2:66,623] these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting,  

[17:3:66,633] coordination of climate and forest restoration related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial  

[17:4:66,643] landowners, operation of state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects, and  

[17:5:66,652] administration of federal forestry assistance programs.

[12:0:215,574] 3560   State Lands Commission  

[13:0:66,595] The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its  

[13:1:66,605] care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access.  

[13:2:66,614] Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars   in  

[13:3:66,624] revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources.  

[13:4:66,642] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands  

[13:5:66,651] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign  

[13:6:66,661] public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal  

[13:7:66,671] government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands  

[13:8:66,681] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development,  

[13:9:66,690] environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law  

[13:10:66,700] Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the  

[13:11:66,710] trust to the benefit of all Californians.

[1:0:454,13] NATURAL RESOURCES 

[2:0:180,32] 3560   State Lands Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and  

[3:1:66,78] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high  

[3:2:66,88] water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands,  

[3:3:66,98] which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California.  

[3:4:66,108] School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the  

[3:5:66,117] five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state  

[4:0:66,127] ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest  

[4:1:66,137] in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.  

[5:0:66,154] Because the State Lands Commission’s (SLC) programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, SLC has a capital outlay  

[5:1:66,164] program to support this need. For the specifics on the SLC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:66,341] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:0:66,360] 2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[8:0:66,378] The   Mineral Resources Management Division   oversees the efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands.  

[8:1:66,387] The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the  

[8:2:66,397] safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,  

[8:3:66,407] geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public  

[8:4:66,417] safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources  

[8:5:66,426] through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil  

[8:6:66,436] spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and   conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives  

[8:7:66,446] fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the  

[8:8:66,456] oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction.  

[9:0:66,473] Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-

[9:1:66,483] generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to  

[9:2:66,493] administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program.  

[10:0:66,510] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[11:0:66,527] The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural  

[11:1:66,537] and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public  

[11:2:66,547] Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from   Lake  

[11:3:66,556] Tahoe and   the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast   in the west, and include California’s  

[11:4:66,566] two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin.  

[12:0:66,584] The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local  

[12:1:66,593] jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The  

[12:2:66,603] Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for use or development, preserving  

[12:3:66,613] and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands.  

[13:0:66,630] Finally, the Commission manages the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land  

[13:1:66,640] holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.  

[14:0:66,657] 2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION  

[15:0:66,674] The   Marine Environmental Protection Division   regulates marine oil terminals within California, providing the best achievable  

[15:1:66,684] protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals,  

[15:2:66,694] inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification  

[15:3:66,704] programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit  

[15:4:66,714] for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[7:0:66,265] The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the  

[7:1:66,275] habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological value and for their use and enjoyment by the public.  

[8:0:66,295] This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to protect the survival of species and  

[8:1:66,304] natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational,  

[8:2:66,314] commercial, scientific, and educational uses.  

[9:0:66,334] Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[9:1:66,343] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[14:0:66,620] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and  

[14:1:66,630] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most  

[14:2:66,640] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and  

[14:3:66,650] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the  

[14:4:66,660] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural  

[14:5:66,669] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park  

[14:6:66,679] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and  

[14:7:66,689] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,  

[14:8:66,699] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,  

[14:9:66,708] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing

[2:0:69,32] 3820   San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional  

[3:1:66,78] authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance the   San Francisco Bay, and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive  

[3:2:66,88] use. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan, and relies on the McAteer-Petris Act and other  

[3:3:66,98] statutory and regulatory authorities to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission issues permits  

[3:4:66,108] for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and certain  

[3:5:66,117] managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. By  

[3:6:66,127] statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay and  

[3:7:66,137] exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The Commission leads the ongoing multi-

[3:8:66,147] agency regional effort to address the impacts of rising sea level and climate change on the Bay and along the shoreline.

[7:0:66,243] The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to implement the San Diego River Conservancy Act through programs  

[7:1:66,253] emphasizing Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Natural and Cultural Resources, Water Quality and Natural Flood  

[7:2:66,262] Conveyance, Organizational Capacity, and the San Diego Rivers Watershed Consortium. This Conservancy’s mission will be  

[7:3:66,272] accomplished in part by building with our partners the San Diego River Trail stretching over 52 miles from the headwaters in  

[7:4:66,282] Julian to the Pacific Ocean. The Conservancy has established advisory panels to assist in restoring and enhancing three  

[7:5:66,292] nearby watersheds: the Otay River, Sweetwater River, and Tijuana River. Working with stakeholders within these watersheds  

[7:6:66,302] fosters collaboration among governments, public agencies and nonprofit organizations, and leverages grant funding to achieve  

[7:7:66,311] an array of conservation objectives for the region with an emphasis on native habitat restoration and mitigating the impacts of  

[7:8:66,321] climate change, seawater intrusion in local watersheds, sea level rise, and the risk of wildfire and flooding.

[4:0:66,120] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water supply. The Department  

[4:1:66,130] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing  

[4:2:66,139] needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to  

[5:0:66,149] prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its  

[5:1:66,159] efficient use.  

[6:0:66,178] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[6:1:66,188] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:66,256] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:0:66,275] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN  

[8:0:66,292] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water  

[8:1:66,302] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to  

[8:2:66,312] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water  

[8:3:66,322] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water  

[8:4:66,332] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan  

[8:5:66,341] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,  

[8:6:66,351] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,  

[8:7:66,361] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected  

[8:8:66,371] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare  

[8:9:66,380] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure  

[8:10:66,390] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,  

[8:11:66,400] protection of agriculture, and supporting a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water  

[8:12:66,410] Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local  

[8:13:66,420] agencies and tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination.  

[9:0:66,437] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM  

[10:0:66,454] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21  

[10:1:66,464] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,  

[10:2:66,474] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.  

[11:0:66,491] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water  

[11:1:66,501] to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.  

[12:0:66,518] The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,  

[12:1:66,528] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental  

[12:2:66,538] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and  

[12:3:66,547] federal regulations and permits.  

[13:0:66,565] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE  

[14:0:66,582] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper  

[14:1:66,592] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include  

[14:2:66,601] assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use  

[14:3:66,611] of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities,  

[14:4:66,621] coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in  

[14:5:66,631] cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way  

[14:6:66,640] for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and the  

[14:7:66,650] reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities  

[14:8:66,660] associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The  

[14:9:66,670] program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety.  

[15:0:66,687] 3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD  

[16:0:66,707] The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) facilities,

[3:1:66,78] issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that  

[3:2:66,88] protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San  

[3:3:66,98] Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large  

[3:4:66,108] joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than   100 local maintaining agencies that operate and  

[3:5:66,117] maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for  

[3:6:66,127] stakeholders.

[5:0:66,216] California Energy Bond Office is responsible for managing the Electrical Power Fund and the Department of Water Resources  

[5:1:66,226] (DWR) Charge Fund. The Electric Power Fund was created in response to the 2001 California energy crisis; for a limited period  

[5:2:66,235] of time, the Electrical Power Fund purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities and issued $11.3  

[5:3:66,245] billion in bonds. The final amount of the outstanding bonds were defeased in September 2020. Bond proceeds were used to  

[5:4:66,255] repay amounts borrowed for power purchases during the 2001 energy crisis.   The DWR Charge Fund was created in 2019 by  

[5:5:66,265] Chapter 79, Statutes of 2019 (AB 1054) to collect remittances from charges on investor-owned utilities ratepayers pursuant to

[6:0:66,226] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[7:0:66,245] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control  

[7:1:66,255] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage  

[7:2:66,264] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700  

[7:3:66,274] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated  

[7:4:66,284] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate  

[7:5:66,294] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the  

[7:6:66,303] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank  

[7:7:66,313] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,  

[7:8:66,323] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood  

[7:9:66,333] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[12:1:66,585] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and  

[12:2:66,595] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and  

[12:3:66,605] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted  

[12:4:66,615] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.  

[12:5:66,625] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other  

[12:6:66,634] relevant agencies.   The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent  

[12:7:66,644] Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to  

[12:8:66,654] inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
