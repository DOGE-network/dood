[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,91] 4500 - CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION 

[5:0:66,111] The objective of the Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration program is to provide policy direction, accountability, 

[5:1:66,121] administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult and juvenile correctional and rehabilitation programs. 

[5:2:66,131] The program consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs; 

[5:3:66,142] Audits and Court Compliance; Victim and Survivor Rights and Services; Support Services; Enterprise Information Services; 

[5:4:66,152] Labor Relations, Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; and the Office of the 

[5:5:66,162] Ombudsman. 

[6:0:66,180] 4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 

[7:0:66,200] The Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development program is responsible for planning, organizing, analyzing, and 

[7:1:66,210] managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/ 

[7:2:66,221] psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training, as well as employee development 

[7:3:66,231] for all departmental staff, both peace officers and non-peace officers. 

[8:0:66,248] 4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES 

[9:0:66,269] The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services 

[9:1:66,279] provided by the Department of Justice to CDCR. 

[10:0:66,297] 4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 

[11:0:66,314] The Department accepts commitments from California courts provided that the person to be committed meets age 

[11:1:66,325] requirements, can materially benefit from institutional programs, and there are adequate facilities available to care for the 

[11:2:66,335] individual. 

[12:0:66,353] The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities, 

[12:1:66,363] perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, and provide juvenile offenders necessary 

[12:2:66,373] services such as security, feeding, clothing, and facility operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, juvenile 

[12:3:66,383] offender intake and court services, population management services, facility maintenance, and maintains juvenile offender 

[12:4:66,393] master files. This program currently oversees operations for three facilities and one conservation camp. 

[13:0:66,411] Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 

[13:1:66,421] release planning for each offender. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based treatment 

[13:2:66,431] programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption therapy, 

[13:3:66,442] sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp programs, 

[13:4:66,452] and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior and 

[13:5:66,462] reduce recidivism and relapse. 

[14:0:66,480] 4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 

[15:0:66,497] The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the 

[15:1:66,508] California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 

[15:2:66,518] knowledgeable lifelong learner. A key goal for education is to prepare student wards for successful transition to the community 

[15:3:66,528] upon release. 

[16:0:66,546] The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 

[16:1:66,556] Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 

[16:2:66,566] preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State 

[16:3:66,576] Standards and earn the appropriate amount of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education, 

[16:4:66,587] English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for 

[16:5:66,597] work experience. 

[17:0:66,614] 4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 

[18:0:66,635] The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program is to provide medical, dental, and mental health care to juveniles 

[18:1:66,645] consistent with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strives to 

[18:2:66,655] achieve this mission by providing cost-effective, timely, and competent care. In addition, Juvenile Health Care Services is 

[18:3:66,665] responsible for overseeing and implementing the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, which uses evidence-based 

[18:4:66,676] principles of a cognitive behavioral treatment program to guide the development of the best program for the unique needs of 

[18:5:66,686] the youth population.

[11:1:66,378] degree of successful reintegration and release to society of offenders paroled from state prison. The program is responsible for 

[11:2:66,388] providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The main components 

[11:3:66,398] of supervision include Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring, the Sex Offender Management Program which 

[11:4:66,408] incorporates the containment model strategy as required by statute, and general caseload supervision utilizing the California

[11:6:66,429] Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism. 

[12:0:66,446] Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the offender's risk 

[12:1:66,457] and current service needs. Based on case assessments, parolees may be placed in a higher-supervision category intended to 

[12:2:66,467] prevent, detect, or interrupt behavior likely to endanger the community. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification 

[12:3:66,477] are regularly scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community.

[3:1:66,75] OFFENDERS 

[4:0:66,95] The objective of the California Sex Offender Management Board is to promote public safety through research and certification 

[4:1:66,106] of providers and programs to assure they are using evidence-based practices in treating sex offenders. The objective of the 

[4:2:66,116] State Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders Committee is to select and train providers on the best evidence-

[4:3:66,126] based risk assessment tools in the treatment of sex offenders. 

[5:0:66,144] 4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS 

[6:0:66,161] The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and 

[6:1:66,172] decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process. 

[7:0:66,189] For adult offenders, the Board of Parole Hearings is responsible for setting the terms and conditions of parole and conducting 

[7:1:66,200] parole consideration hearings for eligible inmates serving life sentences, including certain parole violators pursuant to Penal 

[7:2:66,210] Code Section 3000.1. In January 2014, the Board began conducting youth offender parole hearings for eligible offenders 

[7:3:66,220] sentenced under both the Indeterminate Sentence Law and Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to Chapter 312, Statutes of 

[7:4:66,230] 2013. In 2014, the Board also began conducting parole hearings for inmates eligible for elderly parole sentenced under both 

[7:5:66,240] the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to a federal court order. Beginning in January 

[7:6:66,251] 2015, the Board started evaluating certain inmates sentenced under the state's Second Strike Law for parole, pursuant to the 

[7:7:66,261] same federal court order. The Board also conducts medical parole hearings and determines whether parolees should be 

[7:8:66,271] discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for mentally disordered offenders and sexually violent predators, and 

[7:9:66,281] subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of Mental Health. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board 

[7:10:66,291] investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons and commutations of sentence, including those involving 

[7:11:66,302] the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the 

[7:12:66,312] inmate's significant health condition. 

[8:0:66,329] Chapter 312, Statutes of 2013 (SB 260) required the Board to establish parole suitability hearings for offenders who were under 

[8:1:66,340] 18 at the time they committed their controlling offense. Chapter 471, Statutes of 2015 (SB 261) extended the youth offender 

[8:2:66,350] hearings to inmates who were under the age of 23 at the time of their offense. SB 261 specified that the Board complete a new 

[8:3:66,360] comprehensive risk assessment for each youth offender scheduled for a parole hearing that specifically addresses the 

[8:4:66,370] diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to that of adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth 

[8:5:66,380] and increased maturity of the individual. Chapter 675, Statutes of 2017 (AB 1308) expands youth offender hearings to inmates 

[8:6:66,391] who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense. 

[9:0:66,408] For juvenile offenders, the Juvenile Parole Board is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from the

[1:0:164,43] 5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and 

[2:1:66,74] technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal 

[2:2:66,84] justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 public safety realignment. 

[2:3:66,95] This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices, including prevention, intervention, 

[2:4:66,105] suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with 

[2:5:66,115] the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for 

[2:6:66,125] managing criminal justice populations. 

[3:0:66,143] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 

[3:1:66,153] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 

[3:2:66,163] Overview."

[1:0:215,43] 5420   Prison Industry Authority 

[2:0:66,64] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 

[2:1:66,74] in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 

[2:2:66,84] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 

[2:3:66,95] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee, 

[2:4:66,105] the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker 

[2:5:66,115] of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the 

[2:6:66,125] Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the 

[2:7:66,135] Board. 

[3:0:66,153] The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good 

[3:1:66,163] work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA 

[3:2:66,174] work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming. 

[4:0:66,191] The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 

[4:1:66,201] provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within 

[4:2:66,212] enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work 

[4:3:66,222] productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work 

[5:0:66,232] programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services 

[5:1:66,242] to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its 

[5:2:66,252] operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
