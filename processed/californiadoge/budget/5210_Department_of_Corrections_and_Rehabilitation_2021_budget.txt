[17:0:66,441] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[18:0:65,460] • Adult Inmate and Parolee Population—Compared to the 2020 Budget Act projections, the adult inmate average daily  

[18:1:76,471] population is projected to decrease by 25,316 in 2020-21, and decrease by 16,277 in 2021-22, to a total of 97,220 and  

[18:2:76,481] 106,259, respectively. This decline is primarily due to actions taken to reduce the prison population in response to the  

[18:3:76,491] COVID-19 Pandemic. The average daily parolee population is projected to increase by 6,282 in 2020-21 and by 340 in  

[18:4:76,501] 2021-22, to a total of 54,211 and 48,269, respectively. These increases are similarly related to accelerated releases in  

[18:5:76,511] response to the pandemic. When compared to the projected average daily population at the 2020 Budget Act, these  

[18:6:76,522] changes result in a decrease of $184 million General Fund in 2020-21, and a decrease of $142.4 million in 2021-22.  

[18:7:76,532] However, given various factors including continued staffing needs, the Budget only reflects savings of $146.3 million General  

[18:8:76,542] Fund in 2020-21, and savings of $123.5 million in 2021-22.  

[19:0:65,558] • Adult Medical and Pharmaceutical—Existing Medical Classification Model staffing ratios would have resulted in decreases of  

[19:1:76,568] $41.7 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $31 million in 2021-22. However, to avoid reducing medical staffing at the height  

[19:2:76,579] of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Budget reflects adjusted 2020-21 savings of $6 million General Fund. Additionally, the  

[19:3:76,589] Budget reflects savings of $15.5 million General Fund in 2021-22 to better reflect CDCR’s true operating costs for the  

[19:4:76,599] Medical Program. The out-years reflect the estimated full-year savings of $31 million General Fund. The Budget also  

[19:5:76,609] includes decreases of $108.8 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $10.4 million in 2021-22 to reflect savings on 

[19:6:76,619] pharmaceuticals.  

[20:0:65,636] • Adult Contract Medical Program—The Budget includes decreases of $61.9 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $37.2  

[20:1:76,646] million in 2021-22 to reflect a reduction of contract medical services provided to inmates outside the prison. This reduction is  

[20:2:76,656] attributable to the overall reduction in the adult inmate population. These amounts are also reflected in the “Adult Inmate and  

[20:3:76,666] Parolee Population” fiscal details above.  

[21:0:65,682] • Mental Health Program—Compared to the 2020 Budget Act projections, the population of inmates requiring outpatient  

[21:1:76,693] mental health treatment is projected to decrease by 6,245 inmates in 2020-21, and 6,409 inmates in 2021-22, for totals of  

[21:2:76,703] 28,269 and 28,105, respectively. Based on the current Mental Health Staffing Ratios, these changes would have resulted in  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:122,32] 5225   Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:76,69] decreases of $38.4 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $45 million in 2021-22 and ongoing. However, the Budget does not  

[3:1:76,79] reflect all savings in 2020-21, and instead reflects adjusted savings of $1.9 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $4.2 million  

[3:2:76,89] ongoing to better align with the projected operating costs for the Mental Health program.  

[4:0:65,105] • Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) Population—Compared to 2020 Budget Act projections, the 2021 Budget Act estimates an  

[4:1:76,115] average daily population of 732 juveniles in 2020-21 and 613 juveniles in 2021-22, which represents a decrease of 123  

[4:2:76,126] wards in 2020-21 and 242 wards in 2021-22, respectively. Accordingly, the Budget reflects savings of $2.6 million General  

[4:3:76,136] Fund in 2020-21 and $10.6 million in 2021-22. Per Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021  

[4:4:76,146] (SB 92), DJJ ceased intake on July 1, 2021, except for limited exceptions, and is scheduled to close on June 30, 2023.  

[5:0:65,162] • COVID Expenditure Offset—Although the standard population adjustments are expected to result in the General Fund  

[5:1:76,172] savings outlined above, CDCR has also incurred significant costs related to COVID-19 response. CDCR currently estimates  

[5:2:76,183] it incurred costs of $1 billion in 2020-21 related to COVID-19 response activities. To partially fund these expenditures, the  

[5:3:76,193] Budget assumes all 2020-21 General Fund population savings ($270.8 million) will be diverted to cover a portion of CDCR’s  

[5:4:76,203] 2020-21 COVID expenditures.  

[6:0:65,219] • COVID-19 Direct Response Expenditures—The Budget includes a total of $1.7 billion for various state departments for direct  

[6:1:76,229] response costs associated with responding to and mitigating the impacts of the pandemic in 2021-22. Specifically, the  

[6:2:76,240] Budget includes $408 million General Fund for CDCR for the estimated costs associated with inmate and staff testing, the  

[6:3:76,250] purchase of personal protective equipment, tents and other temporary structures to support physical distancing, additional  

[6:4:76,260] cleaning, and reimbursements to counties for costs related to the suspended intake of inmates from county jails.

[7:2:76,297] $517,000 Inmate Welfare Fund beginning in 2022-23 associated with the planned September 2021 closure of Deuel

[8:2:76,343] process changes, and increased supervisory staffing measures at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, as well as  

[8:3:76,354] video surveillance on two yards at the California State Prison, Los Angeles County.  

[9:0:65,370] • Armstrong Court Compliance Continuation—The Budget includes $3.7 million General Fund in 2020-21, $80.5 million in  

[9:1:76,380] 2021-22, and $28 million ongoing for CDCR to comply with court-ordered video surveillance, body-cameras, staff complaint  

[9:2:76,390] process changes, and increased supervisory staffing measures at five institutions: California State Prison, Corcoran;  

[9:3:76,400] Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison at Corcoran; California Institution for Women; Kern Valley State  

[9:4:76,411] Prison; and California State Prison, Los Angeles County.  

[10:0:65,427] • Statewide Process for Use of Force and Prison Rape Elimination Act Allegations—The Budget includes $7.9 million ongoing  

[10:1:76,437] General Fund for CDCR to enhance the department’s ability to proactively address allegations of staff misconduct. These  

[10:2:76,447] resources will allow CDCR to make improvements on both an institution and system-wide level with the overarching goal of  

[10:3:76,457] increased accountability and transparency.  

[11:0:65,474] • Expansion of Fixed Video Surveillance—The Budget includes $37.6 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $2.1 million

[12:1:76,520] declining to $18.3 million in 2024-25 and ongoing, for technology to enhance rehabilitative programming. Specifically, the  

[12:2:76,531] initiative includes the purchase of approximately 37,000 laptop computers for use by academic program participants and the  

[12:3:76,541] creation of a secure online academic portal that will allow students to complete educational curriculum outside of the  

[12:4:76,551] classroom.  

[13:0:65,567] • Valley State Prison Enhancements—The Budget includes $13.7 million General Fund in 2021-22, $3.4 million in 2022-23,  

[13:1:76,577] and $3 million ongoing to make facility modifications and expand rehabilitative programming opportunities at Valley State  

[13:2:76,588] Prison consistent with the Norway model.  

[14:0:65,604] • Inmate Visitation Expansion to Three Days—The Budget includes $20.3 million ongoing General Fund to add a third day of  

[14:1:76,614] visiting at the institutions and provide visitors with free transportation on select days throughout the year to all prisons on

[8:0:66,372] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and  

[8:1:66,382] technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal  

[8:2:66,392] justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety  

[8:3:66,403] Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention,  

[8:4:66,413] intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is  

[8:5:66,423] consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based  

[8:6:66,433] strategies for managing criminal justice populations.  

[9:0:66,451] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a  

[9:1:66,461] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[13:0:215,490] 5420   Prison Industry Authority  

[14:0:66,512] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries  

[14:1:66,522] in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate  

[14:2:66,532] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections  

[14:3:66,542] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee,  

[14:4:66,553] the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker  

[14:5:66,563] of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the  

[14:6:66,573] Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the  

[14:7:66,583] Board.  

[15:0:66,604] The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good  

[15:1:66,614] work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA  

[15:2:66,624] work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming.  

[16:0:66,644] The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that  

[16:1:66,655] provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within  

[16:2:66,665] enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work  

[16:3:66,675] productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work  

[16:4:66,685] programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services  

[16:5:66,695] to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its  

[16:6:66,706] operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
