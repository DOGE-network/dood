[1:0:242,39] 3100   Exposition Park  

[2:0:66,60] The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are  

[2:1:66,70] located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these  

[2:2:66,79] three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park.  

[3:0:66,97] The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park  

[3:1:66,106] usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of  

[3:2:66,116] the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve,  

[3:3:66,126] and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the  

[3:4:66,136] western United States.  

[4:0:66,153] Because   the Science Center's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the   Science Center   has a capital outlay  

[4:1:66,163] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,238] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,257] 2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER  

[7:0:66,277] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and  

[7:1:66,286] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops  

[7:2:66,296] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.  

[8:0:66,316] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological  

[8:1:66,326] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,  

[8:2:66,335] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. The Science Center’s Air and Space Center, the permanent home  

[8:3:66,345] for the Space Shuttle Endeavour, will be constructed by the California Science Center Foundation. In July 2021, the Foundation  

[8:4:66,355] reached the fundraising threshold required to begin construction. The entire bond financing process was completed in October  

[8:5:66,365] 2021, and construction is expected to begin in early 2022.  

[9:0:66,384] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The  

[9:1:66,394] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and  

[9:2:66,404] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a  

[9:3:66,414] Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The  

[9:4:66,423] school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards.  

[10:0:66,443] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those  

[10:1:66,453] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding  

[10:2:66,462] support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.  

[11:0:66,480] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,499] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management  

[12:1:66,509] and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events,  

[12:2:66,519] and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is  

[12:3:66,529] responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of  

[12:4:66,538] park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park  

[13:0:66,548] Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in  

[13:1:66,558] addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood.  

[14:0:66,575] 2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM  

[15:0:66,592] The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the  

[15:1:66,602] Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of  

[15:2:66,612] African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African  

[15:3:66,622] American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear  

[15:4:66,631] campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility  

[15:5:66,641] in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public  

[15:6:66,651] programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture,  

[15:7:66,661] historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and  

[15:8:66,671] to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at  

[15:9:66,680] large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty  

[15:10:66,690] years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an  

[15:11:66,700] inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

[6:0:201,200] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy  

[7:0:66,221] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational  

[7:1:66,231] resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs  

[7:2:66,240] that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants for or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed  

[7:3:66,250] restoration; and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances  

[7:4:66,260] these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by  

[7:5:66,270] acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.  

[8:0:66,289] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to  

[8:1:66,299] restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.   The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the  

[8:2:66,309] Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed  

[8:3:66,319] to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[8:4:66,328] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 

[9:0:66,348] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program  

[9:1:66,358] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[11:0:66,539] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[11:1:66,558] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY  

[12:0:66,575] The Conservancy manages nearly 4,700 state-owned properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of  

[12:1:66,585] quarter-acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits,  

[12:2:66,594] and have significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple  

[12:3:66,604] benefits and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and  

[12:4:66,614] encroachments. Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental  

[12:5:66,624] role of the Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational  

[12:6:66,633] amenities, including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe.  

[13:0:66,651] The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to  

[13:1:66,661] more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a  

[13:2:66,670] wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also  

[13:3:66,680] increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire,  

[13:4:66,690] clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This  

[13:5:66,700] work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change.

[2:0:166,32] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site  

[3:1:66,78] improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating  

[3:2:66,88] public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake.  

[3:3:66,105] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  

[4:0:66,125] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing  

[4:1:66,135] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide  

[4:2:66,144] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds  

[4:3:66,154] such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.  

[5:0:66,171] In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting  

[5:1:66,181] urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive  

[5:2:66,191] Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town  

[5:3:66,201] center objectives.   Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other  

[5:4:66,211] environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

[3:0:66,69] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[4:0:66,87] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 10 residential and 16 non-residential  

[4:1:66,97] facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training,  

[4:2:66,107] and educational opportunities to young adults. The facilities also allow the CCC to assist federal, state and local agencies, as  

[4:3:66,117] well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources.  

[4:4:66,134] The CCC residential facilities house 80 to 100 corpsmembers each and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people  

[4:5:66,144] together from across the state, and increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential  

[4:6:66,154] centers range in size from 30 to 60 corpsmembers and are located in both urban and rural communities throughout California.

[8:0:66,390] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:0:66,409] 2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION  

[10:0:66,426] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,  

[10:1:66,436] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and  

[10:2:66,446] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets; and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,  

[10:3:66,456] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about  

[10:4:66,465] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.  

[11:0:66,483] 2425 - GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[12:0:66,500] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as   much  

[12:1:66,510] as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and  

[12:2:66,519] environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of  

[12:3:66,529] hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for  

[12:4:66,539] program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries. 

[13:0:66,556] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION  

[14:0:66,574] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program  

[14:1:66,583] provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local  

[14:2:66,593] governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts  

[14:3:66,603] for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development  

[14:4:66,613] rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops  

[14:5:66,622] maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use  

[14:6:66,632] decisions.  

[15:0:66,649] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION  

[16:0:66,667] This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface  

[16:1:66,677] Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim  

[16:2:66,686] mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and  

[16:3:66,696] remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.  

[17:0:66,713] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD  

[18:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:171,32] 3480   Department of Conservation - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of  

[3:1:66,78] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine  

[3:2:66,88] Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans,  

[3:3:66,98] and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to  

[3:4:66,108] comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local  

[3:5:66,117] government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

[5:0:164,168] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  

[6:0:66,189] The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue, and  

[7:0:66,199] disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership in the protection of life, property, and natural resources in  

[7:1:66,209] California.  

[8:0:66,228] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety  

[8:1:66,238] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency  

[8:2:66,248] response.  

[9:0:66,267] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing  

[9:1:66,277] diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention  

[9:2:66,287] awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management.  

[10:0:66,306] CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to  

[10:1:66,316] enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland  

[10:2:66,326] areas of California.  

[11:0:66,345] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support  

[11:1:66,355] this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:215,89] 3560   State Lands Commission  

[2:0:66,110] The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its  

[2:1:66,120] care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access.  

[2:2:66,130] Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars   in  

[2:3:66,139] revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources.  

[3:0:66,157] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands  

[3:1:66,166] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign  

[3:2:66,176] public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal  

[3:3:66,186] government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands  

[3:4:66,196] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development,  

[4:0:66,205] environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law  

[4:1:66,215] Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the  

[4:2:66,225] trust to the benefit of all Californians.  

[5:0:66,242] Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and  

[5:1:66,252] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high  

[5:2:66,262] water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands,  

[5:3:66,272] which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California.  

[5:4:66,281] School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the  

[5:5:66,291] five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state  

[6:0:66,301] ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest  

[6:1:66,311] in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.  

[7:0:66,328] Because the State Lands Commission’s (SLC) programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, SLC has a capital outlay  

[7:1:66,338] program to support this need. For the specifics on the SLC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[12:1:66,532] The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the  

[12:2:66,542] safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,  

[12:3:66,552] geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public  

[12:4:66,562] safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources  

[12:5:66,572] through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil  

[12:6:66,581] spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and   conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives  

[12:7:66,591] fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the  

[12:8:66,601] oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction.  

[13:0:66,618] Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-

[13:1:66,628] generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to  

[13:2:66,638] administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program.  

[13:3:66,655] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[14:0:66,672] The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural  

[14:1:66,682] and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public  

[14:2:66,692] Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from   Lake  

[14:3:66,702] Tahoe and   the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast   in the west, and include California’s  

[14:4:66,711] two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin.  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:180,32] 3560   State Lands Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local  

[3:1:66,78] jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The  

[3:2:66,88] Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for use or development, preserving  

[3:3:66,98] and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands.  

[4:0:66,115] Finally, the Commission manages the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land  

[4:1:66,125] holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.  

[4:2:66,142] 2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION  

[5:0:66,159] The   Marine Environmental Protection Division   regulates marine oil terminals within California, providing the best achievable  

[5:1:66,169] protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals,  

[5:2:66,179] inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification  

[5:3:66,189] programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit  

[5:4:66,198] for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous  

[5:5:66,208] species into California waters through the operations of oceangoing vessels. The program funds and conducts scientific  

[5:6:66,218] research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing  

[5:7:66,228] vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions.  

[5:8:66,245] 9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION  

[6:0:66,262] The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction, and administrative support to the

[10:0:197,480] 3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife  

[11:0:66,501] The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the  

[11:1:66,511] habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological value and for their use and enjoyment by the public.  

[12:0:66,530] This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to protect the survival of species and  

[12:1:66,540] natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational,  

[12:2:66,550] commercial, scientific, and educational uses.  

[13:0:66,569] Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[13:1:66,579] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[13:2:66,589] Overview."

[5:1:66,183] 2790 - COASTAL CONSERVANCY PROGRAM  

[5:2:66,200] The Coastal Conservancy seeks to achieve the following goals:  

[6:0:65,218] • Protect and enhance habitats, wetlands, scenic open space, working lands and urban waterfronts along the California coast  

[6:1:76,227] and around San Francisco Bay.  

[7:0:65,243] • Increase public access to the coast and outdoor recreational opportunities by creating new parks, trails and recreational  

[7:1:76,253] amenities.  

[8:0:65,269] • Prepare for and reduce the unavoidable impacts of climate change on the coastal region and San Francisco Bay Area.  

[8:1:65,284] • Support education projects and programs related to the preservation, enhancement, and enjoyment of coastal resources.  

[8:2:65,300] • Facilitate improvement of existing, and the development of new, lower cost accommodations within one and one-half miles of  

[8:3:76,310] the coast.

[10:3:66,376] that increase public access to the coast. The Conservancy has participated in the protection of more than 390,000 acres of  

[10:4:66,386] coastal lands through acquisition of fee title and conservation easements. The Conservancy has helped restore more than  

[10:5:66,396] 33,000 acres of habitat.  

[11:0:66,415] Through its projects, the Conservancy has established approximately 160 new coastal accessways and built more than 168  

[11:1:66,425] miles of new trails.  

[12:0:66,442] State Coastal Conservancy funds are primarily expended for purposes of local assistance but may also be expended for capital  

[12:1:66,452] outlay purposes, see Program 2820.

[7:0:183,263] 3790   Department of Parks and Recreation  

[8:0:66,284] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and  

[9:0:66,294] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most  

[9:1:66,304] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and  

[9:2:66,313] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the  

[9:3:66,323] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural  

[9:4:66,333] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park  

[9:5:66,343] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and  

[9:6:66,352] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,  

[9:7:66,362] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,  

[9:8:66,372] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing  

[9:9:66,382] financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.  

[10:0:66,401] Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need.  

[10:1:66,411] For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[11:0:66,480] The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to implement the San Diego River Conservancy Act through programs  

[11:1:66,490] emphasizing Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Natural and Cultural Resources, Water Quality and Natural Flood  

[11:2:66,499] Conveyance, Organizational Capacity, and the San Diego Rivers Watershed Consortium. This Conservancy’s mission will be  

[11:3:66,509] accomplished in part by building with our partners the San Diego River Trail stretching over 52 miles from the headwaters in  

[11:4:66,519] Julian to the Pacific Ocean. The Conservancy has established advisory panels to assist in restoring and enhancing three  

[11:5:66,529] nearby watersheds: the Otay River, Sweetwater River, and Tijuana River. Working with stakeholders within these watersheds  

[11:6:66,538] fosters collaboration among governments, public agencies and nonprofit organizations, and leverages grant funding to achieve  

[11:7:66,548] an array of conservation objectives for the region with an emphasis on native habitat restoration and mitigating the impacts of  

[11:8:66,558] climate change, seawater intrusion in local watersheds, sea level rise, and the risk of wildfire and flooding.

[6:0:66,223] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water supply. The Department  

[6:1:66,232] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing  

[6:2:66,242] needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to  

[7:0:66,252] prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its  

[7:1:66,262] efficient use.  

[8:0:66,281] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[8:1:66,291] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[15:0:66,495] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[16:0:66,514] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN  

[17:0:66,532] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water  

[17:1:66,541] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to  

[17:2:66,551] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water  

[17:3:66,561] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water  

[17:4:66,571] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan  

[17:5:66,580] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,  

[17:6:66,590] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,  

[17:7:66,600] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected  

[17:8:66,610] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare  

[17:9:66,620] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure  

[17:10:66,629] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,  

[17:11:66,639] protection of agriculture, and supporting a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water  

[17:12:66,649] Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local  

[17:13:66,659] agencies and tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination.  

[18:0:66,676] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM  

[19:0:66,693] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21  

[19:1:66,703] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,  

[19:2:66,713] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.  

[20:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:161,32] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water  

[3:1:66,78] to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.  

[4:0:66,96] The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,  

[4:1:66,105] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental  

[4:2:66,115] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and  

[4:3:66,125] federal regulations and permits.  

[5:0:66,142] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE  

[6:0:66,159] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper  

[6:1:66,169] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include

[1:0:454,13] NATURAL RESOURCES 

[2:0:161,32] 3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control  

[3:1:66,78] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage  

[3:2:66,88] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700  

[3:3:66,98] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated  

[3:4:66,108] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate  

[3:5:66,117] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the  

[3:6:66,127] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank  

[3:7:66,137] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,  

[3:8:66,147] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood  

[3:9:66,156] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[2:0:66,90] Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is  

[2:1:66,100] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and  

[2:2:66,109] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and  

[3:0:66,119] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted  

[3:1:66,129] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.  

[3:2:66,139] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other  

[3:3:66,148] relevant agencies.   The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent  

[3:4:66,158] Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to  

[3:5:66,168] inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
