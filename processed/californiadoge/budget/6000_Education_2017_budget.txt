[0:0:58,15] EDUCATION   2017-18 STATE BUDGET — EDU 1 

[1:0:214,44] 6100 Department of Education 

[1:1:58,64] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 

[1:2:58,73] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million 

[1:3:58,82] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Services for Administration, 

[1:4:58,91] Finance, Technology, and Infrastructure Branch; Instruction, Learning, and Support Branch; the Student Support and 

[1:5:58,100] Special Services Branch; the District, School and Innovation Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch. 

[2:0:58,118] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and 

[2:1:58,127] to work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) 

[3:0:58,136] holding local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local 

[4:0:58,145] capacity to enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, 

[4:1:58,154] and supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide 

[4:2:58,163] leadership that promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and 

[5:0:58,172] effectiveness in the administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management 

[6:0:58,181] practices, (f) providing broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) 

[6:1:58,190] establishing and fostering systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and 

[7:0:58,199] intellectual support to help students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing 

[7:1:58,208] statewide leadership that promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve 

[7:2:58,217] students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department. 

[8:0:58,235] Because department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay 

[8:1:58,244] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department of Education's Capital Outlay Program, see 

[8:2:58,253] "Infrastructure Overview."

[4:1:58,180] The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals 

[4:2:58,189] by K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test 

[4:3:58,198] of substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a 

[4:4:58,207] statutory timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear standards for compliance 

[4:5:58,216] with education funding requirements, and allow both the state and local educational agencies to avoid lengthy and 

[4:6:58,225] expensive litigation over disputed funding.

[15:2:58,718] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place 

[15:3:58,727] on July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469) increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over

[1:0:75,44] 6300 State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] three years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The CalSTRS Board can increase the 

[2:1:58,82] state's contribution by 0.50 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 

[3:0:58,100] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 

[3:1:58,109] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 

[3:2:58,118] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389) increased the amount of supplemental purchase power 

[3:3:58,127] protection payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The CalSTRS Board is required 

[3:4:58,136] to set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 

[3:5:58,145] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of 

[3:6:58,154] an amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 

[3:7:58,163] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 

[3:8:58,172] 15 of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the CalSTRS 

[3:9:58,181] Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) increase 

[3:10:58,190] employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[3:1:58,183] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 

[3:2:58,192] such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs. 

[4:0:58,210] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 

[4:1:58,219] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Proposition 1D, approved in November 2006, provided State 

[4:2:58,228] General Obligation Bonds of $5.2 billion to local educational agencies for new construction and modernization projects. 

[4:3:58,237] Further, Proposition 1D provided $2.1 billion for Charter Schools, Career Technical Education Facilities, Overcrowding 

[4:4:58,246] Relief, High Performance Incentive Grants, and Joint-Use projects. The SFP also contains provisions for Critically 

[5:0:58,255] Overcrowded Schools and Seismic Mitigation. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, extends the existing 

[5:1:58,264] SFP and authorized a total of $7 billion in State General Obligation Bonds for local educational agencies school construction 

[5:2:58,273] projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 billion for new construction, $3 

[5:3:58,282] billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical education projects.

[0:0:58,15] EDUCATION   2017-18 STATE BUDGET — EDU 49 

[1:0:220,44] 6440 University of California 

[1:1:58,64] The University of California (UC) provides higher education through (1) instruction in undergraduate, graduate, and 

[1:2:58,73] professional degree programs and postdoctoral programs; (2) research; (3) education for professional careers; and (4) 

[1:3:58,82] public service. 

[2:0:58,100] The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 

[2:1:58,109] 1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the 

[2:2:58,118] following 28 members: 7 ex officio members, 20 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12- 

[2:3:58,127] year terms, and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 

[3:0:58,145] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates the UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for 

[4:0:58,154] research. In addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment 

[4:1:58,163] primarily responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 

[5:0:58,181] There are ten UC campuses as follows: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, 

[5:1:58,190] Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses and offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional 

[5:2:58,199] education. The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching 

[5:3:58,208] hospitals in the counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange. The university administers 

[5:4:58,217] more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. The university provides oversight of one United 

[5:5:58,226] States Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy 

[5:6:58,235] laboratories. 

[6:0:58,253] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and 

[6:1:58,262] resource allocation. The 10 chancellors are responsible for management of individual campuses. The Regents have 

[6:2:58,271] delegated authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

[8:0:205,467] 6600 Hastings College of the Law 

[8:1:58,488] The mission of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (Hastings) is to train students for the legal profession 

[8:2:58,497] with a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the law. Hastings was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton 

[8:3:58,506] Hastings, the first Chief Justice of the State of California. The Legislature provided for affiliation with the University of 

[9:0:58,515] California. Hastings is the oldest law school and one of the largest public law schools in the United States. The business of 

[9:1:58,524] the college is managed by the Board of Directors. The Board has 11 directors: one is an heir or representative of S.C. 

[9:2:58,533] Hastings and the other 10 are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. Directors serve for 12-year terms. 

[9:3:58,542] Hastings is approved by the American Bar Association and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges 

[9:4:58,551] and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Hastings is a member of the Association of American 

[9:5:58,560] Law Schools. The Juris Doctor degree is granted by the Regents of the University of California and is signed by the 

[9:6:58,569] President of the University of California and the Chancellor and Dean of Hastings College of the Law. 

[10:0:58,587] Because department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department assesses its need for new or 

[10:1:58,596] renovated facilities and has significant input into capital planning and the capital outlay program to support this need. For 

[10:2:58,605] specifics on the Hasting's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 5530 - This program provides support for the College. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 

[3:1:58,127] INSTRUCTION 

[4:0:58,145] Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 

[4:1:58,154] profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 

[4:2:58,172] The principal objectives are to (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the 

[4:3:58,181] legal profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide 

[4:4:58,190] students with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments on legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of 

[4:5:58,199] professionalism for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and 

[4:6:58,208] responsibilities of lawyers in overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 

[4:7:58,226] ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 

[5:0:58,244] The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to 

[5:1:58,253] reference and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for 

[5:2:58,262] classroom presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, and legal clinic assignments, and to support legal 

[5:3:58,271] scholarship. The law library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 

[5:4:58,289] STUDENT SERVICES 

[6:0:58,307] Student services includes admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support 

[6:1:58,316] Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide 

[6:2:58,325] students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist 

[6:3:58,334] students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment opportunities. 

[6:4:58,343] These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support Program 

[6:5:58,352] (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other services to 

[6:6:58,361] supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 

[6:7:58,379] INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 

[7:0:58,397] Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public 

[7:1:58,406] safety, community relations, and administrative services. 

[7:2:58,424] OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 

[8:0:58,442] Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 

[8:1:58,451] administration of maintenance and renovation activities of the college's plant. 

[8:2:58,469] EXTRAMURAL 

[9:0:58,487] Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. 

[9:1:58,496] These include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

[14:0:211,444] 6610 California State University 

[15:0:58,464] The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate 

[15:1:58,473] instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs. For undergraduate programs, each 

[15:2:58,482] campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to 

[15:3:58,491] master's-level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctorate programs in education, nursing practice, and physical therapy. 

[15:4:58,500] The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 

[15:5:58,518] The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16 

[15:6:58,527] members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, and 4 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 

[15:7:58,536] student representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, 1 faculty representative, and 1 alumni representative). The Trustees 

[15:8:58,545] appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide 

[15:9:58,554] policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses, recommends 

[15:10:58,563] academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 

[15:11:58,581] The program goals include: 

[16:0:58,597] • 

[16:1:58,615] • 

[16:2:58,624] • 

[16:3:58,633] • 

[16:4:58,651] • 

[16:5:58,660] • 

[17:0:68,599] Providing instruction in the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, applied fields that require more than two years of 

[17:1:68,608] college education, and teacher education. 

[17:2:68,617] Providing public services to the people of California. 

[17:3:68,626] Providing services to students enrolled in the university. 

[18:0:68,635] Preparing administrative leaders for elementary and secondary schools and community colleges by awarding the 

[18:1:68,644] doctorate degree in education. 

[19:0:68,653] Preparing physical therapists by awarding the doctorate degree in physical therapy. 

[20:0:68,662] Preparing faculty to teach in postsecondary nursing programs by awarding the doctorate degree in nursing practice. 

[20:1:58,680] Because department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay 

[20:2:58,689] program to support this need. For specifics on the California State University's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure 

[20:3:58,698] Overview."

[10:0:58,530] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[11:0:58,548] The California State University (CSU) system includes 23 campuses and 7 off-campus centers throughout the state. While 

[11:1:58,557] each campus in the system has its own unique geographic and curricular character, 22 campuses can be characterized as 

[11:2:58,566] multipurpose institutions, offering undergraduate and graduate instruction for professional and occupational goals. The 

[11:3:58,575] California Maritime Academy has a specialized mission, focusing on marine transportation and engineering, and maritime 

[11:4:58,584] sciences. The CSU system has a total of 2,187 buildings with 89.1 million gross square feet on 25,354 acres. Starting with 

[11:5:58,593] the 2015-2016 fiscal year, CSU was granted the authority to fund infrastructure projects from their support appropriation.

[11:0:162,487] 6645 CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 

[11:1:58,508] This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 

[11:2:58,517] dependents. 

[12:0:58,535] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health 

[12:1:58,544] plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 

[12:2:58,562] The 2016-17 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula 

[12:3:58,571] established in Government Code section 22871 for members with five years of service. Under this formula, the state 

[12:4:58,580] averages the premiums of the four largest health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes 

[12:5:58,589] towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of 

[12:6:58,598] each of the retiree's dependents. 

[13:0:58,616] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are 

[13:1:58,625] determined on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2016 monthly 

[13:2:58,634] contribution maximums are $705 for a single enrollee, $1,343 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee 

[13:3:58,643] and two or more dependents. The 2017 monthly contribution maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an 

[13:4:58,652] enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

[5:1:58,271] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 

[5:2:58,280] California's 72 community college districts, which operate 114 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed 

[5:3:58,289] by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student 

[5:4:58,298] members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms. 

[5:5:58,316] The objectives of the Board are to: 

[6:0:58,331] • 

[6:1:58,340] • 

[6:2:58,349] • 

[7:0:68,334] Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 

[7:1:68,343] Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 

[8:0:68,352] Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 

[8:1:58,370] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 

[8:2:58,379] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM 

[4:0:58,118] This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students pay for 

[4:1:58,127] educational expenses. The financial aid programs are described below. 

[5:0:58,145] CAL GRANT A and B 

[6:0:58,163] Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and 

[6:1:58,172] other general program eligibility requirements. The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are 

[6:2:58,181] guaranteed to certain community college students who have community college GPAs of at least 2.4 on a four-point scale. 

[7:0:58,199] Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility 

[7:1:58,208] requirements. Half of these awards are offered to those applicants who did not receive an entitlement award and meet a 

[7:2:58,217] March 2 deadline. The remaining awards are offered to students who are enrolled at a California community college and 

[7:3:58,226] meet a September 2 deadline. 

[8:0:58,244] Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 grade 

[8:1:58,253] point average (GPA) on a four-point scale. 

[9:0:58,271] Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point 

[9:1:58,280] scale. The award is for books and living expenses for the first year. Beginning with the second year, the award also provides 

[9:2:58,289] funds for tuition and fees. 

[10:0:58,307] The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the 

[10:1:58,316] University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU). The award at private nonprofit institutions and 

[10:2:58,325] private, for profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the award 

[10:3:58,334] at private, for profit institutions that are not WASC-accredited are determined in the budget. 

[11:0:58,352] OTHER STUDENT AWARDS 

[12:0:58,370] The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 

[13:0:58,388] The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students of no more than 40 percent 

[13:1:58,397] of the UC or CSU mandatory systemwide tuition and fees.
