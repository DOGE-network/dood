[3:0:66,65] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[3:1:65,83] •   Bureau of Real Estate Transition—Pursuant to Chapter 828, Statutes of 2017 (SB 173), effective July 1, 2018, the Bureau of 

[3:2:76,93] Real Estate is removed from the Department of Consumer Affairs and established as the Department of Real Estate under 

[3:3:76,104] the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency. With the Bureau of Real Estate’s exit and efforts by the pro rata 

[3:4:76,114] work group to improve services and achieve operational efficiencies, the Department of Consumer Affairs’ budget is reduced 

[3:5:76,124] by $2 million and 16 positions in 2018-19, which will reach a total reduction of $3.5 million and 26 positions by 2020-21. 

[3:6:65,140] •   Statewide Cannabis Programs—The Budget includes $34.8 million Cannabis Control Fund for the continued implementation 

[3:7:76,150] of licensing and enforcement programs for the testing, distribution, and retail sale of recreational and medicinal cannabis, 

[3:8:76,161] including the establishment of regional offices for licensing and cash collection, and a public awareness campaign of the 

[3:9:76,171] benefits of the legalized market. The Budget includes $10 million Cannabis Tax Fund for the Bureau of Cannabis Control to 

[3:10:76,181] select a public university or universities to research and evaluate the implementation and effect of the Proposition 64. 

[3:11:76,191] Additionally, the Budget includes $10 million General Fund for the Bureau of Cannabis Control to provide grants to local

[1:0:134,43] 2240   Department of Housing and Community Development 

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Housing and Community Development's (HCD's) mission is to preserve and expand safe and affordable 

[2:1:66,74] housing opportunities and promote strong communities for all Californians by (1) administering housing finance, economic 

[3:0:66,84] development, and community development programs, (2) developing housing policy and advocating for an adequate housing 

[3:1:66,95] supply, and (3) developing building codes and regulating manufactured homes and mobilehome parks. HCD also provides 

[3:2:66,105] technical and financial assistance to local agencies to support community development. 

[4:0:66,123] The California Housing Finance Agency's (CalHFA's) mission is to create and finance progressive housing solutions so more 

[5:0:66,133] Californians have a place to call home. CalHFA, a statutorily independent agency and component unit of state government, is 

[5:1:66,143] not subject to Budget Act appropriation. CalHFA is financially self-supporting, setting loan interest rates slightly above its cost 

[5:2:66,153] and charging fees to cover its lending costs and risks. Effective July 1, 2013, pursuant to the Governor's Reorganization Plan 

[6:0:66,163] No. 2 of 2012, CalHFA is displayed, for budgetary purposes only, within HCD's budget, and reports to the Business, Consumer 

[6:1:66,174] Services and Housing Agency.

[6:0:66,281] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[6:1:65,299] •   No Place Like Home - The Budget submits the No Place Like Home program to the voters at the November 6, 2018 

[6:2:76,309] statewide general election. This program dedicates up to $2 billion in bond proceeds to address homelessness for 

[6:3:76,319] individuals with mental health needs through the provision of permanent supportive housing. The Budget allows the voters to 

[6:4:76,330] validate the program’s use of Proposition 63 Mental Health Services Act funds, rather than waiting for validation through the 

[6:5:76,340] courts, thus expediting the expenditure of these critical homelessness funds. To enable the Department to issue awards as 

[6:6:76,350] soon as possible, the Budget includes a $1.2 million General Fund loan to release a notice of funding availability and review 

[6:7:76,360] applications in anticipation of voter approval. 

[7:0:65,376] •   SB 2 Homelessness Funds - The Budget includes programmatic provisions to quickly distribute the homelessness funds 

[7:1:76,387] available from the first year of SB 2 real estate transactions fee revenue. These provisions split available homelessness 

[7:2:76,397] funds between the Housing for a Healthy California program and an expanded Emergency Solutions Grant program. This 

[7:3:76,407] approach strikes a balance between longer-term permanent housing solutions and short-term fixes to address current 

[7:4:76,417] homelessness challenges at the local level. 

[8:0:65,433] •   Statewide Housing Package Implementation - The Budget provides $538.3 million from various funds and 81.0 positions in 

[8:1:76,444] 2018-19, $793.9 million and 128.0 positions in 2019-20, $796.1 million and 146.0 positions in 2020-21 and 2021-22, and 

[8:2:76,454] $796 million and 145.0 positions in 2022-23 and ongoing to implement the recent legislative housing package. The housing 

[8:3:76,464] package shortens the housing development approval process, promotes local accountability to adequately plan for needed 

[8:4:76,474] housing, and invests in affordable housing production. Funding sources include an anticipated $4 billion voter-approved 

[8:5:76,484] housing bond and dedicated real estate transaction fee revenues.
