[6:1:66,229] The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and  

[6:2:66,239] establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal  

[6:3:66,250] and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  

[6:4:66,267] Because the Legislature's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to  

[6:5:66,278] support this need.   For the specifics on the Legislature's   capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,69] The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was  

[3:1:66,79] completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for  

[3:2:66,89] construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.   The Annex, which was  

[3:3:66,99] completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices.  

[3:4:66,117] Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored,  

[3:5:66,127] rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

[10:0:139,471] 0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System  

[10:1:66,492] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional  

[10:2:66,502] officers, and legislative statutory officers.  

[11:0:66,523] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of  

[11:1:66,533] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,  

[11:2:66,543] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.   The Legislators'  

[11:3:66,553] Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 

[12:0:66,574] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November  

[12:1:66,584] 6, 1990.   Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340)  

[12:2:66,594] closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory  

[12:3:66,604] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[11:0:242,576] 0250   Judicial Branch  

[12:0:66,597] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of  

[12:1:66,608] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.  

[12:2:66,618] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially  

[12:3:66,628] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.  

[13:0:66,648] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent  

[13:1:66,659] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was  

[13:2:66,669] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This  

[13:3:66,679] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The  

[13:4:66,689] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty  

[13:5:66,699] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments  

[13:6:66,710] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted

[2:0:207,32] 0250   Judicial Branch - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act  

[3:1:66,79] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the  

[3:2:66,89] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial  

[4:0:66,99] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are  

[4:1:66,109] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of  

[5:0:66,120] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities  

[5:1:66,130] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.  

[6:0:66,150] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,  

[6:1:66,160] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United  

[6:2:66,171] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.  

[7:0:66,191] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay  

[8:0:66,201] program to support this need. For   the specifics on   the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[30:0:64,605] 1/ Reflects the 2020-21 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the trial courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for 2020-21. Non-state  

[30:1:64,611] funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[31:0:64,617] 2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees. 

[31:1:64,625] 3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 trial courts based on courts' 2021-22 Schedule 1 submissions. 

[32:0:64,633] 4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation. 

[33:0:64,640] 5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in  

[33:1:64,647] the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1. 

[34:0:64,653] 6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in  

[35:0:64,659] Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial  

[35:1:64,664] Courts" (Figure 2) amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for the "State Trial Court Funding Total."
[36:0:64,670] 7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences. For  

[36:1:64,676] current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[37:0:64,683] 8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2020-21 and estimated expenditures for 2021-22 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2021-22 Enacted Budget.

[19:0:39,290] 1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, GF, and JBWCF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state  

[19:1:39,298] operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). Expenditures for 2021-22 are rounded to the nearest thousand. 

[19:2:39,311] 2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding,  

[19:3:39,319] Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount  

[19:4:39,326] in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1).  

[20:0:39,335] 3/ Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2020-21 and 2021-22 participated in the local salary  

[20:1:39,343] reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

[21:1:39,362] (DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects the appropriated  

[21:2:39,368] funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program (FFDRP). 

[22:0:39,381] 5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred  

[22:1:39,389] to the JBWCF. For the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF. 

[23:0:39,402] 6/ The 2020-21 estimated rent is incorporated into the request from each program that houses employees.

[8:2:66,476] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of  

[8:3:66,486] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or  

[8:4:66,496] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.  

[8:5:66,506] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.  

[9:0:66,527] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial  

[9:1:66,537] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation  

[9:2:66,547] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal  

[9:3:66,557] from office.  

[10:0:66,578] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the  

[10:1:66,588] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,  

[10:2:66,598] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.  

[10:3:66,608] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[5:0:150,140] 0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System  

[6:0:66,162] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and  

[6:1:66,172] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement  

[6:2:66,182] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.  

[7:0:66,200] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in  

[7:1:66,210] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System  

[7:2:66,220] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final  

[7:3:66,231] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement  

[7:4:66,241] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of  

[7:5:66,251] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined  

[7:6:66,261] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II is funded  

[7:7:66,271] through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. The state's contributions are adjusted  

[7:8:66,282] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.  

[8:0:66,302] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,  

[9:0:66,312] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges  

[9:1:66,322] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing  

[9:2:66,333] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit  

[9:3:66,343] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the  

[9:4:66,353] required benefit payments to retired judges.  

[10:0:66,373] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of  

[10:1:66,384] 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[13:2:66,572] (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, staff complaints, and the employee disciplinary process. The Inspector  

[13:3:66,582] General audits and reviews the policies, practices, and procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's  

[13:4:66,593] candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the  

[13:5:66,603] state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at  

[13:6:66,613] each state prison. OIG receives communications from individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-

[13:7:66,623] free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of  

[13:8:66,633] complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper management where a legally cognizable cause of action is  

[13:9:66,644] present; and reviews sexual abuse incidents within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the

[14:1:66,682] health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for incarcerated individuals and parolees. C-ROB meets at  

[14:2:66,692] least twice annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of rehabilitation and treatment programs. C-ROB

[10:0:66,455] The Office of Planning and Research (OPR) assists the Governor and the Administration in planning, research, policy  

[10:1:66,465] development, and legislative analysis. OPR formulates long-range state goals and policies to address four key areas: land use  

[10:2:66,475] and planning, climate risk and resilience, sustainable economic development, and targeted long-range research needs. OPR  

[10:3:66,485] acts as the state's liaison to a variety of entities including local and regional government, planning professionals, small  

[10:4:66,496] business, and the Department of Defense. OPR also serves a role as convener across multiple agencies on cross-cutting  

[10:5:66,506] issues in the four key areas of our work.  

[11:0:66,526] The Office of Planning and Research includes three main budget programs: the State Policy Program (often referred to as  

[11:1:66,536] OPR), which houses most of core planning and research functions; the California Strategic Growth Council, which coordinates  

[11:2:66,547] and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and stakeholders to realize healthy, thriving, resilient communities  

[11:3:66,557] for all and provides direct grant funding to projects demonstrating the value and feasibility of sustainable communities; and  

[11:4:66,567] California Volunteers, a program aimed to increase the number and impact of Californians involved with service and  

[11:5:66,577] volunteering throughout the state.

[13:0:66,565] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency  

[13:1:66,575] response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's  

[13:2:66,586] Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's  

[13:3:66,596] homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for,  

[13:4:66,606] protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats.  

[13:5:66,624] Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal  

[13:6:66,634] agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in  

[13:7:66,644] emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own  

[13:8:66,654] resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the  

[13:9:66,664] federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.  

[13:10:66,682] During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's  

[13:11:66,692] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal  

[13:12:66,703] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the

[3:0:66,69] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes  

[3:1:66,79] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  

[4:0:66,97] Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and  

[4:1:66,107] the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS  

[4:2:66,117] assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of   and response to criminal and terrorist activity and   also facilitates  

[4:3:66,127] information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners.  

[5:0:66,145] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety   Commission   is a separate unit within the   Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to  

[5:1:66,155] lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well  

[5:2:66,165] as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management.  

[6:0:66,183] Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this  

[6:1:66,193] need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[2:0:167,32] 0690   Office of Emergency Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] †   Fiscal year 2020-21 budget information reflects the latest available estimates for this department and/or fund(s). Changes  

[3:1:66,83] resulting from the final reconciliation of the 2020-21 ending fund balance will be reflected as a prior year adjustment in the  

[3:2:66,93] 2023-24 Governor’s Budget publication.  

[4:0:66,120] LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY  

[5:0:66,139] DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY  

[6:0:66,160] Government Code, Title 2, Division 1, Chapter 7 and Chapter 12; Government Code, Title 2, Division 3, Part 6.5;   Government  

[6:1:66,170] Code, Title 5, Division 2, Part 1, Chapter 1, Article 6; Penal Code, Part 4, Title 6, Chapter 3.  

[7:0:66,207] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:0:74,226] ◦ Safeguarding the Availability and Delivery of Emergency Supplies and Commodities—The Budget includes $114.3 million  

[8:1:85,236] General Fund one-time to provide warehouse space, purchase new and replace expiring personal protective equipment,  

[8:2:85,247] increase commodity supply for an all-hazard event, and secure logistic support equipment. This proposal will support  

[8:3:85,257] California’s ability to act quickly and help ensure appropriate resources are available across the state for all emergencies.  

[9:0:74,273] ◦ Nonprofit Security Grant Program—The Budget includes $50 million General Fund one-time to provide security assistance  

[9:1:85,283] to nonprofit organizations at risk of hate-motivated violence, which includes members of the Asian American Pacific  

[9:2:85,293] Islander, LGBTQ+, Black, and Jewish communities. Security enhancement projects include reinforced doors and gates,  

[9:3:85,304] high-intensity lighting and alarms, and other security-related improvements.  

[10:0:74,320] ◦ Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System—The Budget includes $30 million ongoing General Fund, approximately  

[10:1:85,330] $24 million in Cal OES's budget, to establish   the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS) program  

[10:2:85,340] to   increase the real-time information and situational awareness available to the state and   California’s   mutual aid system  

[10:3:85,350] responders and managers on all hazards events, including wildfires. FIRIS will utilize a combination of aircraft, high-

[10:4:85,361] definition real time video, and data analysis dispatched   24/7   throughout the state to provide nearly instantaneous,  

[10:5:85,371] accurate visual situation awareness that informs public safety and emergency management operational and   tactical  

[10:6:85,381] decisions.   Early detection and rapid intelligence   allows   for the strategic and efficient allocation of resources   before,  

[10:7:85,391] during,   and   after   disaster incidents, and a more effective response to reduce loss of life and property. The intelligence  

[10:8:85,401] gathered will   also provide data and   support   to the Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center, as  

[10:9:85,412] established through SB 209 (Chapter   405, Statutes   of   2019).  

[11:0:74,428] ◦ Responding to the Pandemic—The Budget includes $29.5 million General Fund one-time to continue COVID-19 testing  

[11:1:85,438] efforts and provide resources to activate the state’s mutual aid system in the event of future outbreaks. 

[12:0:74,454] ◦ Providing Local Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Deployment Resources—The Budget includes $25 million General Fund for  

[12:1:85,464] three years and five positions to provide local law enforcement support during disasters and emergencies. This funding  

[12:2:85,475] will reduce local costs, accelerate response time, and provide sustainable participation of all 58 counties within the State  

[12:3:85,485] Law Enforcement Mutual Aid system by minimizing funding considerations from the decision-making process.  

[13:0:74,501] ◦ California Earthquake Early Warning System—The Budget includes $17.1 million ongoing General Fund to support  

[14:0:85,511] education and outreach, operations, and research and development of the California Earthquake Early Warning Program.  

[14:1:85,521] This funding will allow the state to increase its earthquake sensor density in the rural parts of Northern California and the  

[14:2:85,532] Sierra Nevada Microwave Telemetry project, and offer grants to community-based organizations to educate socially  

[14:3:85,542] isolated groups and other under-served communities. Cal OES will also undertake new research in the use of Frequency  

[14:4:85,552] Modulation radio frequencies, television broadcasting networks, and crowd sourcing for expanded modalities of alerting  

[14:5:85,562] the public when a significant earthquake occurs.  

[15:0:74,578] ◦ Enhancing the Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid Fire Fleet—The Budget includes $11.2 million General Fund ($10.9 million  

[15:1:85,589] ongoing) and 11 positions to enhance the California State Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System’s fire fleet. The Fire and  

[15:2:85,599] Rescue Division provides federal, state, and local firefighting and rescue surge capacity. Given the severity and increased  

[15:3:85,609] frequency of wildfires in California, the potential for earthquakes, floods, mud and debris flows, and hazardous materials  

[15:4:85,619] incidents, these resources will enhance the capacity of the mutual aid system to meet the demands of the state’s disaster  

[15:5:85,629] response entities.  

[16:0:74,646] ◦ 988 Suicide Hotline Implementation—The Budget includes $7.5 million General Fund ($6 million ongoing) and 10  

[17:0:85,656] positions to implement a new federally mandated 988 call system to increase the ease and accessibility to provide help for  

[17:1:85,666] those considering suicide or self-harm.   Those who dial 988 will be directed to one of the existing 13 Lifeline Call Centers  

[17:2:85,676] across the state.   These centers already provide immediate assistance with mental distress, and the additional funding will  

[17:3:85,686] ensure those needing services receive help more efficiently.   The Budget includes funding for call handling equipment so  

[17:4:85,697] existing crisis hotline centers have the needed resources to process additional 988 calls and coordinate and transfer calls  

[17:5:85,707] with no loss of information between the 988 and 911 systems.

[3:0:74,69] ◦ Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force—The Budget includes $5 million General Fund for three years to support the  

[3:1:85,79] Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program, which helps state and local law enforcement agencies develop an  

[3:2:85,89] effective response to technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and combatting underground child pornography rings.

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES  

[5:0:66,105] Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program  

[5:1:66,115] coordinates the provision   of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended  

[5:2:66,126] in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-

[5:3:66,136] hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National  

[5:4:66,146] Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this  

[5:5:66,156] program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to  

[5:6:66,166] all hazards.  

[6:0:66,184] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,202] Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services  

[7:1:66,212] grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland  

[7:2:66,222] Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency  

[7:3:66,232] management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant  

[7:4:66,243] management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with  

[7:5:66,253] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the  

[7:6:66,263] centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion

[9:0:66,309] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent  

[9:1:66,319] earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s  

[9:2:66,329] progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.   The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate,  

[9:3:66,339] and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.   The  

[9:4:66,349] Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support  

[9:5:66,360] the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.   These activities include: (1) developing and  

[9:6:66,370] reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related  

[9:7:66,380] legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies,  

[9:8:66,390] where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and  

[9:9:66,400] supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery.  

[10:0:66,418] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS  

[11:0:66,439] The Public Safety Communications   program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the  

[11:1:66,449] state's   public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The   program is dedicated to the  

[11:2:66,459] preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that  

[11:3:66,469] keep the public connected during times of crisis.  

[12:0:66,487] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE  

[13:0:66,507] The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of   Cal OES and support services such as

[8:1:66,486] civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them, prosecutes cases to vindicate state  

[8:2:66,496] interests, and conducts investigations. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases

[4:3:66,127] investigations are conducted by multidisciplinary teams consisting of Special Agents, Investigative Auditors, Digital Forensic  

[4:4:66,137] Specialists, Registered Nurses, and Deputy Attorneys General. Deputy Attorneys General from the Division represent the

[6:1:66,247] Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief.  

[7:0:66,267] The Bureau of Firearms (BOF) provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms and  

[7:1:66,277] ammunition   laws by administering a multitude of different state-mandated firearms and ammunition-related programs. It is  

[7:2:66,288] accomplished by conducting firearm and ammunition eligibility checks, conducting compliance inspections at firearm dealers,  

[7:3:66,298] ammunition vendors, and manufacturers, and by providing valuable training to stakeholders statewide. BOF Special Agents  

[7:4:66,308] conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of firearms,  

[7:5:66,318] magazines, and ammunition. Finally, BOF Special Agents conduct investigations to monitor and   prevent illegal   firearm  

[7:6:66,328] trafficking at permitted gun shows in accordance with state and federal laws.  

[8:0:66,349] The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and scientific analysis of physical evidence, crime scene  

[8:1:66,359] investigation, and scientific investigative support for officer-involved shooting investigations. Additionally BFS provides expert  

[8:2:66,369] court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts. The BFS operates 10  

[8:3:66,379] regional crime laboratories and two specialized laboratories, the Jan Bashinski DNA Laboratory and Statewide Toxicology  

[8:4:66,390] Laboratory, which   serve 46 of California’s 58 counties. The BFS also operates the California Criminalistics Institute forensic  

[8:5:66,400] training facility that provides training for forensic scientists worldwide. Finally, BFS maintains the state DNA database, which  

[8:6:66,410] stores and regularly searches the DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees against the DNA profiles of  

[8:7:66,420] evidence from unsolved crimes.  

[9:0:66,441] The Bureau of Gambling Control (BGC) regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted  

[9:1:66,451] honestly and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of  

[9:2:66,461] individuals and business entities who apply for licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance  

[9:3:66,471] with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. BGC conducts criminal investigations in and around tribal casinos  

[9:4:66,481] and California cardrooms. In addition, BGC conducts audits and reviews for tribal gaming to ensure that each tribe is in

[10:6:66,573] forces focusing on violent offenders, gangs, and major crimes statewide.  

[11:0:66,594] The Office of the Chief (Office) provides administrative support to the investigative, regulatory, and forensic components of the  

[11:1:66,604] Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office serves as the policy-making and oversight body for  

[11:2:66,614] its four operational bureaus.  

[12:0:66,632] 0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES

[13:1:66,662] services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary services:

[1:0:410,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — LJE   187 

[2:0:181,32] 0845   Department of Insurance - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to make sure they can provide  

[3:1:66,79] the benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and  

[3:2:66,89] underlying assumptions to ensure transparency and consistency in models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by  

[3:3:66,99] insurance companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty  

[3:4:66,109] insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the California Insurance Code  

[3:5:66,120] and the California Code of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance  

[3:6:66,130] sector; (6) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance  

[3:7:66,140] companies to get unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases  

[3:8:66,150] are actuarially justified and not excessive; (8) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses,  

[3:9:66,160] satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent  

[3:10:66,171] insurance companies through the Conservation and Liquidation Office.  

[3:11:66,188] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION  

[4:0:66,206] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders  

[4:1:66,216] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or  

[4:2:66,226] underwriting by insurers and producers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent  

[4:3:66,237] practices and from incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved  

[4:4:66,247] and historically disadvantaged communities; and (4) assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community  

[4:5:66,257] service organizations, and neighborhood associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed  

[4:6:66,267] informational guides, workshops, seminars, roundtables, and town halls.  

[4:7:66,285] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL  

[5:0:66,303] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for  

[5:1:66,313] prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace  

[5:2:66,323] officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the  

[5:3:66,333] Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition,  

[5:4:66,343] the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against  

[5:5:66,354] perpetrators of insurance fraud.  

[6:0:66,371] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE  

[7:0:66,389] This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws  

[7:1:66,399] contained in the Insurance Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and  

[7:2:66,409] Fee Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the  

[7:3:66,420] premium tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

[11:0:66,641] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an  

[12:0:66,651] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it  

[13:0:66,661] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to  

[13:1:66,671] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by  

[13:2:66,681] the State Senate.

[1:0:410,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — LJE   193 

[2:0:148,32] 0850   California State Lottery Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34  

[3:1:66,79] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be  

[3:2:66,89] used for administrative costs.  

[4:0:66,107] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost  

[4:1:66,117] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of  

[4:2:66,127] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery  

[4:3:66,137] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily  

[4:4:66,148] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the  

[4:5:66,158] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.  

[4:6:66,175] In the 36 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2021, the California State Lottery has raised $39.4 billion  

[4:7:66,186] for public education, including approximately $1.9 billion in FY 2020-21.  

[5:0:66,203] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2021-22 and 2022-23 cannot be made  

[5:1:66,214] with certainty.

[6:0:66,437] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:1:66,456] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES  

[7:0:66,477] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption.  

[7:1:66,487] During the 2020-21 fiscal year, this Division handled 11,021 security investment transactions totaling $524.9 billion. The Pooled  

[7:2:66,497] Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 9,721 of these transactions totaling $487.5 billion; time deposits  

[7:3:66,507] accounted for 932 transactions totaling $26.1 billion. The remaining $11.3 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special  

[7:4:66,517] funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's  

[7:5:66,528] retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment  

[7:6:66,538] program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the  

[7:7:66,548] 2020-21 fiscal year, 2,387 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $34.0 billion for the fiscal year.  

[7:8:66,566] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT  

[8:0:66,583] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System  

[8:1:66,594] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires  

[8:2:66,604] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,  

[8:3:66,614] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,  

[8:4:66,624] and loans to the General Fund.  

[9:0:66,642] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of  

[9:1:66,652] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that  

[9:2:66,662] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer  

[9:3:66,673] maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for  

[9:4:66,683] the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies.  

[10:0:66,700] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts  

[10:1:66,711] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer  

[11:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[4:1:66,158] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The  

[4:2:66,168] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to  

[4:3:66,178] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.  

[5:0:66,199] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse  

[5:1:66,209] consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance   includes monitoring  

[5:2:66,219] the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and  

[5:3:66,229] ensuring proper record keeping.  

[6:0:66,247] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES  

[7:0:66,265] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support

[13:1:66,632] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State  

[13:2:66,642] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,  

[13:3:66,652] such as the creation of affordable housing.  

[14:0:66,670] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual  

[14:1:66,680] basis. The bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by multiplying the state population by $110 in 2021; a factor determined  

[14:2:66,690] by the IRS each year. California's limit totaled over $4.3 billion in 2021.

[3:0:66,69] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,88] 0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[4:0:66,116] The Committee administers various programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity  

[4:1:66,126] bonds. Below is a summary of each program:  

[5:0:66,144] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost to develop multifamily rental  

[5:1:66,154] housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers produce  

[5:2:66,164] affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and families. To  

[5:3:66,175] qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or reserve at  

[5:4:66,185] least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for  

[5:5:66,195] four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint  

[5:6:66,205] Application.  

[6:0:66,223] Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance any of the following facilities identified by the IRS  

[6:1:66,233] as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities,  

[6:2:66,243] high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the  

[6:3:66,253] project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to  

[6:4:66,264] protect and enhance the environment.  

[7:0:66,281] Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to assist first-time  

[7:1:66,292] homebuyers with purchasing homes. Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached,  

[7:2:66,302] condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the  

[7:3:66,312] program's purchase price limitations.  

[8:0:66,330] Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds  

[8:1:66,340] issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and  

[8:2:66,350] midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their  

[8:3:66,360] communities.

[15:2:66,698] fund transportation projects backed in whole or in part, by various revenue streams of transportation funds (including toll  

[15:3:66,708] revenues). Statutes provide the authority to approve the imposition and collection of tolls on proposed transportation projects

[2:0:122,32] 0964   California Transportation Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] under certain conditions. The planning, programming, and allocation of transportation projects are performed by the California  

[3:1:66,79] Transportation Commission and the California Department of Transportation, as appropriate.  

[4:0:166,116] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee  

[5:0:66,138] The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and  

[5:1:66,148] maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California.  

[6:0:66,166] The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years  

[6:1:66,176] after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with federal and state tax credit program requirements of the Internal  

[6:2:66,186] Revenue Service, State law and the Committee. Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private  

[6:3:66,196] investors, the Committee helps to create and maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing throughout California.  

[6:4:66,214] The Committee consists of seven members, including five voting members and two advisors. The voting members are the  

[6:5:66,224] Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her  

[7:0:66,234] representative), the State Controller, the Director of Housing and Community Development, and the Executive Director of the  

[7:1:66,244] California Housing Finance Agency. The non-voting (advisory) members are two local government representatives. One local  

[7:2:66,255] representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a county  

[7:3:66,265] government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

[5:0:66,365] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,384] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[7:0:66,405] The Federal Program  

[8:0:66,422] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax  

[8:1:66,432] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise  

[8:2:66,443] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and  

[8:3:66,453] indexed for inflation.  

[9:0:66,471] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the  

[9:1:66,481] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability  

[9:2:66,491] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of  

[9:3:66,501] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project  

[9:4:66,511] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each  

[9:5:66,522] year for a ten-year period.  

[10:0:66,539] The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation. For 2021, each  

[10:1:66,549] state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.81 per state resident. Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share  

[10:2:66,560] of unused credits in a national pool.  

[11:0:66,577] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects  

[11:1:66,588] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there  

[11:2:66,598] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments.  

[11:3:66,615] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires  

[11:4:66,626] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.  

[11:5:66,643] The State LIHTC Program  

[12:0:66,661] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the  

[12:1:66,671] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for  

[12:2:66,681] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax  

[12:3:66,692] credit status.  

[13:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:410,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — LJE   241 

[2:0:131,32] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2021, was $109.7 million. Investors take the state tax credit  

[3:1:66,79] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.  

[3:2:66,97] Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit  

[3:3:66,107] Allocation Committee to issue an additional $500 million in state tax credits in 2020 to be paired with the 4% federal program to  

[3:4:66,117] bolster new construction of low income housing. Per AB 83, this $500 million tax credit was issued in 2021 pursuant to an  

[3:5:66,127] authorization in the annual Budget Act or related legislation.  

[3:6:66,145] Farmworker Housing Program  

[4:0:66,163] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state  

[4:1:66,173] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,  

[4:2:66,183] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and  

[4:3:66,193] projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.

[4:1:279,195] Authority  

[4:2:66,216] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes  

[4:3:66,226] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently  

[4:4:66,237] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the  

[4:5:66,247] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  

[4:6:66,257] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,  

[4:7:66,267] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and  

[4:8:66,277] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit  

[4:9:66,288] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities  

[4:10:66,298] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.  

[5:0:66,318] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director  

[5:1:66,328] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,  

[5:2:66,339] and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[7:0:66,415] 0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY  

[8:0:66,436] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the  

[8:1:66,446] Authority,   loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and  

[8:2:66,456] approved by resolution of the Authority.  

[9:0:66,474] The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and  

[9:1:66,484] private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects  

[9:2:66,494] in California.  

[10:0:66,515] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative  

[10:1:66,525] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program   expanded   (Chapter 677, Statutes of  

[10:2:66,535] 2012)   to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes  

[10:3:66,545] of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment  

[10:4:66,555] that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product.   In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended  

[10:5:66,566] the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria  

[10:6:66,576] by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. The objective of this program is to promote the creation of California-based  

[10:7:66,586] manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy  

[10:8:66,596] consumption.  

[11:0:66,617] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013  

[11:1:66,627] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority  

[11:2:66,637] developed a loan loss reserve program   for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and   a risk  

[11:3:66,647] mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. Programs to support low-interest  

[11:4:66,657] financing of Property Assessed Clean Energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings are in discussion.  

[12:0:66,678] The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in  

[12:1:66,688] collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission   to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot programs   to  

[12:2:66,698] encourage and leverage private capital lending   (in both the residential and commercial sectors). These programs   employ  

[12:3:66,708] various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making   energy efficiency

[1:0:410,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — LJE   249 

[2:0:116,32] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] 0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,86] CPCFA’s Tax-Exempt Bond Program provides access to the tax-exempt bond market for private companies serving a public  

[4:1:66,97] purpose, through the use of private activity bonds, for California businesses, for the acquisition, construction, or installation of  

[4:2:66,107] qualified waste disposal, waste recovery, water furnishing, and wastewater treatment, or the acquisition and installation of new  

[4:3:66,117] equipment. Small businesses may receive financial assistance towards the costs of issuance.  

[5:0:66,135] Tax-exempt financing issued by CPCFA assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California  

[5:1:66,145] Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly  

[5:2:66,155] Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). As of June 30,  

[5:3:66,165] 2021, bonds totaling approximately $16.7 billion have been issued by CPCFA.  

[6:0:66,183] 0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  

[7:0:66,201] CalCAP for Small Business incentivizes banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses through the  

[7:1:66,211] use of a loan loss reserve account. The program works through   the creation of   a loan loss-reserve fund specific to  

[7:2:66,221] each   participating financial institution. CPCFA, the financial institution, and the borrower all contribute to fund the reserve.  

[7:3:66,231] CPCFA provides additional   incentives for   lending to businesses located in underserved communities and disaster areas. The  

[7:4:66,241] reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk, supporting financial institutions when they lend to California small businesses.  

[8:0:66,259] Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA’s Small Business Assistance Fund  

[8:1:66,269] (SBAF), established   with fees collected from large companies utilizing CPCFA's   tax-exempt bond program.   In October 2010  

[8:2:66,280] CalCAP received $6 million from the General Fund (Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010) to increase lending efforts.   The $6 million  

[8:3:66,290] appropriation   was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to become the primary  

[8:4:66,300] source for the State's contributions.  

[9:0:66,320] In   2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from U.S. Treasury's State Small  

[9:1:66,331] Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). CPCFA shared the allocation with the Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank  

[9:2:66,341] (IBank), now housed within the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). 

[10:0:66,358] These funds enabled CPCFA to expand the availability of its CalCAP for Small Business (CalCAP SB).   In addition, CPCFA  

[10:1:66,369] launched the   Collateral Support Program (CSP)   to   further offset financial institution’s resistance to lend after the 2008  

[10:2:66,379] recession. CPCFA created the CSP with a recapture provision allowing for the sustainability of the program.  

[11:0:66,397] The SSBCI program ended in 2017. In an effort to sustain the program past the sunset date, CalCAP SB instituted a recapture  

[11:1:66,407] provision. Funds are being   recaptured annually to sustain the CalCAP SB and the CSP.  

[12:0:66,424] In 2021, the federal government reauthorized the funding of SSBCI (SSBCI 2.0).   CPCFA and IBank partnered again to apply  

[12:1:66,435] for SSBCI 2.0 allocation and will share the $1.181 billion allocated to California.  

[13:0:66,452] Utilizing the CalCAP model, CPCFA partnered with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to assist   truck and bus owners  

[13:1:66,463] in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds to  

[13:2:66,473] incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that   comply with CARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. CPCFA also partnered with the  

[13:3:66,483] California Energy Commission (CEC) to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit enhancements and rebates to  

[13:4:66,493] small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to   install electric vehicle charging stations. The CalCAP Electric Vehicle  

[13:5:66,503] Charging Station (EVCS) Financing Program ended March 31, 2022.  

[14:0:66,521] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM  

[15:0:66,541] The California Recycle Underutilized Sites (CALReUSE) program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized  

[15:1:66,552] properties with real or perceived contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the  

[15:2:66,562] development of contaminated properties (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000,  

[15:3:66,572] the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per  

[15:4:66,582] brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the  

[15:5:66,592] development of remedial action plans. Eligible projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped  

[15:6:66,603] due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time  

[15:7:66,613] frames and the regulatory process.  

[16:0:66,633] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund  

[16:1:66,643] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received  

[16:2:66,654] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project   for   brownfield remediation that  

[16:3:66,664] promoted affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. Three projects were pre-approved to receive awards of  

[16:4:66,674] more than $5 million; one grant was increased above $5 million when returned funds became available. All CALReUSE  

[16:5:66,684] Program funds have been awarded. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will  

[16:6:66,694] result in 5,587 housing units, of which more than 47% will be affordable, in 30 California communities.

[2:0:116,32] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS  

[4:0:66,89] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative  

[4:1:66,99] energy production, CPCFA is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's  

[4:2:66,109] environmental goals. CPCFA is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and state  

[4:3:66,120] agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.  

[4:4:66,137] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES  

[4:5:66,155] The objective of the California Capital Access program for Americans with Disabilities (CalCAP/ADA) created by Chapter 787,  

[4:6:66,165] Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and increase  

[4:7:66,175] access for   employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other financial institutions to make loans to very small  

[4:8:66,186] businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided CPCFA an appropriation of $10 million effective January  

[4:9:66,196] 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the CalCAP model   incentivizing lenders to enroll qualifying  

[4:10:66,206] loans.   The program also offers borrowers a rebate toward the cost of the Certified Access Specialist (CAS) Report.  

[4:11:66,224] 0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,244] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time  

[5:1:66,254] allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement   program for   qualified small businesses  

[5:2:66,265] and residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of  

[5:3:66,275] Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other  

[5:4:66,285] financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the  

[5:5:66,295] program.  

[6:0:66,313] 0878 - CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,331] The California Investment and Innovation Program is authorized by Chapter 68, Statutes of 2022, (SB 193) and was provided a  

[7:1:66,341] one-time allocation of $50 million from the General Fund into a new special fund, the California Investment and Innovation  

[7:2:66,351] Fund, to support a new grant program to provide local assistance to the state’s Community Development Financial Institutions

[9:0:66,539] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:1:66,558] 0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,576] In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3  

[10:1:66,586] established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program.  

[10:2:66,596] The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable  

[10:3:66,606] and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals and, under Proposition 4, hospitals that  

[10:4:66,616] provide pediatric services for children eligible for California Children’s Services. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is  

[10:5:66,627] derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition  

[10:6:66,637] 3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4.  

[10:7:66,655] 0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES BONDS, LOANS, AND GRANTS

[3:0:66,69] Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of  

[3:1:66,79] the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of  

[3:2:66,89] the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or  

[3:3:66,99] association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district.  

[4:0:66,120] HELP II Loan Program  

[5:0:66,137] The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in  

[5:1:66,148] obtaining financing for their capital needs. The HELP II Program provides two percent and three percent fixed interest rate  

[5:2:66,158] loans of up to $2 million to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost-effective manner.  

[5:3:66,168] HELP II loans may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities, purchase equipment  

[5:4:66,178] and/or furnishings, and refinance existing debt.  

[6:0:66,196] 0890 - MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANTS  

[7:0:66,214] • Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 Grant Program 

[8:0:66,231] Chapter 34, Statutes of 2013 (SB 82), the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 and related legislation provided  

[8:1:66,241] $142.5 million in one-time General Fund, and $4 million in ongoing Mental Health Services Act funding to provide grants for  

[8:2:66,252] community based mental health crisis support.  

[9:0:66,269] The Act established a grant program to disburse funds to California counties or to their nonprofit or public agency designees for  

[9:1:66,280] the purpose of developing mental health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds may be used to increase capacity for client  

[9:2:66,290] assistance and services in crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health  

[9:3:66,300] services, and mobile crisis support teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs.  

[10:0:66,320] • Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for Children and Youth  

[11:0:66,338] Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016 (SB 833), Section 20 created the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for  

[11:1:66,348] Children and Youth to increase mental health services for children and youth 21 years of age and under to develop a complete  

[11:2:66,358] continuum of crisis services. Working with counties, the program funds facility acquisition, construction/renovation, equipment  

[11:3:66,369] acquisition, applicable startup or expansion costs, and limited personnel funding to develop crisis residential treatment and  

[11:4:66,379] crisis stabilization facilities, mobile crisis support teams, and family respite care facilities.  

[12:0:66,399] • Community Services Infrastructure Grants 

[13:0:66,417] Chapter 33, Statutes of 2016 (SB 843), Section 52 created the Community Services Infrastructure Grant Program to expand  

[13:1:66,427] community alternatives to jail and prison. The program seeks to expand access to jail and prison diversion programs and  

[13:2:66,437] services for those with mental health illness, substance use disorders, or who have suffered from trauma. Working with  

[13:3:66,448] counties, the program funds facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs for  

[13:4:66,458] facilities that provide services to this population.  

[14:0:66,475] • No Place Like Home Program  

[15:0:66,493] Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program, which requires the Department  

[15:1:66,503] of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to award up to $2 billion to counties for the acquisition, design, construction,  

[15:2:66,514] rehabilitation, or preservation of permanent supportive housing for individuals living with a severe mental illness who are  

[15:3:66,524] homeless or at risk of chronic homelessness. Chapter 322, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1628) authorized CHFFA to enter into  

[15:4:66,534] contracts with HCD and further authorized CHFFA to issue up to $2 billion in taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the NPLH  

[15:5:66,544] Program. Chapter 41, Statutes of 2018 (AB 1827) placed the NPLH Program on the November 2018 ballot (Proposition 2),  

[15:6:66,554] where it was adopted by the voters as the No Place Like Home Act. This ratified existing law establishing the NPLH Program  

[15:7:66,565] as being consistent with the Mental Health Services Act approved through Proposition 63 in 2004. It also ratified the issuance  

[15:8:66,575] of up to $2 billion in previously authorized bonds.

[10:1:66,493] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD  

[11:0:66,514] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which  

[11:1:66,524] allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can  

[11:2:66,534] make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings.  

[11:3:66,544] ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability  

[11:4:66,555] expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the  

[11:5:66,565] State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.  

[12:0:66,585] The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the  

[12:1:66,595] purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse  

[12:2:66,606] needs of our customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in  

[12:3:66,616] providing financial services.  

[13:0:66,633] Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $15,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's  

[13:1:66,644] ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.

[14:0:66,614] 0900 - The Authority was established to issue up to $650 million in conduit financing to make loans or acquire title to property  

[14:1:66,624] and to underwrite or undertake directly a variety of urban waterfront development projects within the coastal zone, the  

[14:2:66,635] Sacramento-Yolo Port District, the Stockton Port District, and those metropolitan statistical areas meeting specified conditions.  

[14:3:66,645] The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that bonds authorized by the Authority generally be within an allocation from the  

[14:4:66,655] state's ''private activity'' bond limit in order for the bonds to be federally tax-exempt, unless the issuer qualifies as a private,  

[14:5:66,665] nonprofit business.

[6:0:66,173] 0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,194] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance  

[7:1:66,204] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are available for loans to schools and  

[7:2:66,214] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,  

[7:3:66,224] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB  

[7:4:66,234] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.  

[8:0:66,252] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,273] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program  

[9:1:66,283] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the  

[9:2:66,293] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University  

[9:3:66,303] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50  

[9:4:66,313] percent state subsidy for charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the state)  

[9:5:66,324] by the charter school via a 30-year loan. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be financially sound,  

[9:6:66,334] and meet other program eligibility requirements. 

[10:0:66,351] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,369] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA received grants under the United States Department of Education’s State Charter School  

[11:1:66,379] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.  

[11:2:66,390] Grant funds reimburse a charter school’s costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities  

[11:3:66,400] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on  

[11:4:66,410] preference points assigned based on: the percentage of low-income students; percentage of overcrowding; not-for-profit status;  

[11:5:66,420] and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. This program is

[13:0:66,466] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and  

[13:1:66,476] lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged  

[13:2:66,486] students. Eligible charter schools are provided the lesser of $1,313 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, or 75 percent  

[13:3:66,496] of annual facilities rent and lease costs.  

[14:0:66,514] 0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND  

[15:0:66,532] Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of  

[15:1:66,542] up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is  

[15:2:66,552] available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference goes to schools that have

[12:3:66,689] construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or

[3:0:66,69] institution is pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private activity"  

[3:1:66,79] bond ceiling as specified in federal law.  

[4:0:66,109] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "participating private college" means a nonprofit,  

[4:1:66,119] private, regionally accredited, degree-granting college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's  

[4:2:66,129] race or ethnicity and provided that the financing does not violate constitutional provisions.  

[5:0:66,159] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to  

[5:1:66,169] issue tax-exempt public offering or private placement loans for participating institutions, which may provide greater cost savings  

[5:2:66,180] than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.  

[6:0:66,199] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND  

[7:0:66,217] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the

[7:3:66,248] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax
