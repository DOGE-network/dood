[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2021-22 STATE BUDGET — EDU   1 

[1:0:216,39] 6100   Department of Education  

[2:0:66,61] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of  

[2:1:66,71] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million  

[3:0:66,81] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the   Access for All   Branch; the Operations  

[3:1:66,91] and Administration Branch; the Opportunities for All Branch; the Instruction and Measurement Branch; and the Legal and  

[3:2:66,101] Audits Branch.  

[4:0:66,122] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to  

[4:1:66,132] work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding  

[4:2:66,142] local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to  

[4:3:66,152] enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and  

[5:0:66,163] supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that  

[5:1:66,173] promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the  

[5:2:66,183] administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing  

[5:3:66,193] broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering  

[5:4:66,203] systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help  

[5:5:66,214] students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that  

[6:0:66,224] promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the  

[6:1:66,234] effectiveness and efficiency of the Department.  

[7:0:66,254] Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[7:1:66,265] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[7:2:66,275] Overview."

[2:0:163,32] 6125   Education Audit Appeals Panel - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by  

[3:1:66,79] K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of  

[3:2:66,89] substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory  

[3:3:66,99] timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits, including Local School Construction Bond Audits and School Facility  

[3:4:66,109] Program Bond Fund Audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear standards for compliance with education funding requirements, and  

[3:5:66,120] allow both the state and local educational agencies to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over disputed funding.

[3:1:66,118] creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an  

[3:2:66,129] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on  

[3:3:66,139] July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three  

[3:4:66,149] years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase  

[3:5:66,159] the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.  

[4:0:66,177] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in  

[4:1:66,187] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing  

[4:2:66,197] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection  

[4:3:66,208] payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to  

[4:4:66,218] set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to  

[4:5:66,228] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an  

[4:6:66,238] amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding  

[4:7:66,248] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15  

[4:8:66,259] of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’  

[4:9:66,269] Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)  

[4:10:66,279] increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[12:0:66,565] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[13:0:66,585] • The Budget includes $3.9 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS in 2021-22. The roughly $435 million  

[13:1:66,595] increase from the previous fiscal year is largely due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to  

[13:2:66,605] exercise its authority to increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy  

[13:3:66,615] signed into law in 2014. The Budget also includes $174 million one-time General Fund to offset the reduction in the state's  

[13:4:66,625] contributions in 2020-21.  

[14:0:66,643] • The Budget includes a $410 million supplemental pension payment in 2021-22 towards the state’s share of the Defined  

[14:1:66,653] Benefit Program's unfunded liability to be paid out of Proposition 2 debt funding.

[11:0:202,465] 6350   School Facilities Aid Program  

[12:0:66,486] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities  

[12:1:66,496] such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.   This program is administered by the State Allocation  

[12:2:66,506] Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 

[13:0:66,527] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility  

[13:1:66,537] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in  

[13:2:66,547] statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.   These funds primarily  

[13:3:66,557] support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through  

[13:4:66,568] the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding  

[13:5:66,578] relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7)  

[13:6:66,588] seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general  

[13:7:66,598] obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3  

[13:8:66,608] billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical  

[13:9:66,619] education projects.

[5:0:221,204] 6440   University of California  

[6:0:66,226] The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic  

[6:1:66,236] programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service.  

[7:0:66,253] UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 1879 as  

[7:1:66,264] a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the following 26  

[7:2:66,274] members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms,  

[7:3:66,284] and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents.  

[8:0:66,302] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. In  

[8:1:66,312] addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment primarily  

[8:2:66,322] responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law.  

[9:0:66,340] There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa  

[9:1:66,350] Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.  

[9:2:66,360] The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and  

[9:3:66,370] administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States  

[9:4:66,381] Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories.  

[9:5:66,398] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource  

[9:6:66,409] allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated  

[9:7:66,419] authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.  

[10:0:66,436] Because UC’s programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, UC has a capital outlay program to support this need. For  

[10:1:66,447] the specifics on UC's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview.”

[4:1:66,163] Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, was approved by California voters on November 2, 2004,  

[4:2:66,174] providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for stem cell research conducted at California universities, research  

[4:3:66,184] institutions, and companies. It also established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to make grants and loans for  

[4:4:66,194] stem cell research. The Institute's mission is to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs.  

[4:5:66,212] Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research Institute Bond Initiative, was approved by California voters on November 8, 2020,  

[4:6:66,222] authorized $5.5 billion in new general obligation bonds and increased the Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee from 29  

[4:7:66,232] to 35 members, among other administrative and oversight changes.  

[5:0:66,250] The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 35-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public  

[5:1:66,260] officials, appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research  

[5:2:66,270] institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.The 2021-22 Budget Act displays a point in  

[5:3:66,280] time snapshot of   the Institute's   proposed budget that was finalized prior to the passage of Proposition 14 and is based on the  

[5:4:66,291] assumption of expiring Proposition 71 bond authority and declining resources over the next one to two years. Due to the  

[5:5:66,301] difference in the timing of the Institute’s Oversight Board budget meeting and regular state budget deliberations, the Institute’s  

[5:6:66,311] new bond funding will be reflected at the 2022-23 Governor’s Budget.

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 5530 - This program provides support for Hastings.   Expenditures are for the following purposes:  

[4:0:66,105] INSTRUCTION  

[5:0:66,126] Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal  

[5:1:66,136] profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services.  

[6:0:66,156] The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal  

[6:1:66,166] profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students  

[6:2:66,177] with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism  

[6:3:66,187] for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in  

[6:4:66,197] overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice.  

[7:0:66,217] ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY  

[8:0:66,238] The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference  

[8:1:66,248] and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom  

[8:2:66,258] presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law  

[8:3:66,268] library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys.

[10:3:66,340] students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment  

[10:4:66,350] opportunities.   These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support  

[10:5:66,360] Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other  

[10:6:66,370] services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students).

[1:0:498,13] EDUCATION 

[2:0:177,32] 6610   California State University - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate  

[3:1:66,79] instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal arts education programs. For undergraduate programs, each  

[3:2:66,89] campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-

[3:3:66,99] level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and  

[3:4:66,109] audiology. The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 

[3:5:66,127] The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16  

[3:6:66,137] members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student  

[3:7:66,148] representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year  

[3:8:66,158] term by the CSU Alumni Council. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the  

[3:9:66,168] Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty  

[3:10:66,178] representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 

[3:11:66,196] The CSU’s goals include to: 

[4:0:65,214] • Advance and extend knowledge, learning, and culture, especially throughout California.  

[4:1:65,230] • Provide opportunities for individuals to develop intellectually, personally, and professionally.  

[5:0:65,246] • Prepare significant numbers of educated, responsible people to contribute to California’s schools, economy, culture, and  

[5:1:76,256] future.  

[6:0:65,272] • Encourage and provide access to an excellent education to all who are prepared for and wish to participate in collegiate  

[6:1:76,283] study.  

[7:0:65,299] • Offer undergraduate and graduate instruction leading to bachelor’s and higher degrees in the liberal arts and sciences,  

[7:1:76,309] applied fields, and the professions, including the doctoral degree when authorized.  

[7:2:65,325] • Prepare students for international, multi-cultural society.  

[7:3:65,341] • Provide public services that enrich the university and its communities.

[3:0:66,69] in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members  

[3:1:66,79] hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest  

[3:2:66,89] health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also  

[3:3:66,99] contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents.  

[4:0:66,120] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[4:1:66,130] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2020 monthly contribution  

[4:2:66,140] maximums are $767 for a single enrollee, $1,461 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,868 for an enrollee and two or  

[4:3:66,150] more dependents. The 2021 monthly contribution maximums are $798 for a single enrollee, $1,519 for an enrollee and one

[6:0:122,216] 6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges  

[7:0:66,237] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to  

[7:1:66,247] California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 17 voting members and 1  

[7:2:66,258] nonvoting member as specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-

[7:3:66,268] year terms, and must include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-

[7:4:66,278] year terms and include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves  

[7:5:66,288] as a member of the Board.  

[8:0:66,306] The objectives of the Board are to:  

[9:0:66,324] • Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.  

[10:0:66,334] • Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.  

[11:0:66,344] • Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.  

[12:0:66,362] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a  

[12:1:66,372] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see
