[2:0:352,424] Natural Resources Agency programs protect and 

[2:1:352,433] restore California's diverse natural and cultural 

[2:2:352,442] resources for current and future generations, 

[3:0:352,451] including operating state parks, managing water 

[3:1:352,460] supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging 

[3:2:352,469] clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife 

[3:3:352,478] habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources. 

[3:4:352,487] Agency programs also protect the public through 

[3:5:352,496] suppression of wildfires and construction of 

[4:0:352,505] levees in the Central Valley. These programs not 

[4:1:352,514] only contribute to the state's unique quality of 

[4:2:352,523] life, but also are critical to sustaining a vibrant 

[4:3:352,532] economy.

[9:0:58,204] 2300 - EDUCATION 

[10:0:58,222] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the Science Center-Education represents one of California's premier educational 

[10:1:58,231] and family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center 

[10:2:58,240] develops and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 

[11:0:58,258] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 

[11:1:58,267] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 

[11:2:58,276] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its 

[11:3:58,285] temporary home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center 

[11:4:58,294] - its permanent home - is completed. 

[12:0:58,312] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 

[12:1:58,321] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 

[12:2:58,330] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. 

[12:3:58,339] As a Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. 

[12:4:58,348] The school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 

[13:0:58,366] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 

[13:1:58,375] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant 

[13:2:58,384] funding support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation. 

[14:0:58,402] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT 

[15:0:58,420] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services 

[15:1:58,429] management and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of 

[15:2:58,438] park-wide events, and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, and county entities represented within the park. 

[15:3:58,447] OEPM is responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including 

[15:4:58,456] development of park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community 

[15:5:58,465] and in addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood. 

[16:0:58,483] 2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM 

[17:0:58,501] The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the 

[17:1:58,510] Governor. CAAM's mission is history, art and culture. The diverse exhibits are displayed on a seasonal basis in the various 

[17:2:58,519] galleries of the 44,000 square foot building. CAAM delivers its mission to the public through its history and art collections; 

[17:3:58,528] permanent, self-curated, temporary and traveling exhibits; and, innumerable programs and workshops, lectures, seminars, 

[17:4:58,537] films, educational services, standards-based curriculums, and cultural presentations. CAAM facilitates the delivery of these 

[17:5:58,546] services through dozens of outreach efforts including school bus services, docent led tours and creative workshops, through 

[17:6:58,555] Buses & Docents; CAAM Technology Arts Program; employment skill development for high school students under Young 

[17:7:58,564] Docents at CAAM: Conversations at CAAM; Young Voices at CAAM; literacy promotion through Heads are Turning Children 

[17:8:58,573] are Learning; Professional Educator's Open Houses; Films & Shorts at CAAM; off-site workshops and professionally led 

[17:9:58,582] classes in Learning Without Boundaries; and, family and cross-cultural community presentations through Target Sundays at 

[17:10:58,591] CAAM. For these and many other services CAAM is also generously supported with contributions from its 501(c)(3) partner

[11:0:199,526] 3125 California Tahoe Conservancy 

[11:1:58,546] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the extraordinary natural 

[11:2:58,555] and recreational resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and 

[12:0:58,564] implementing programs that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention 

[12:1:58,573] and watershed restoration, improve stream environments and wildlife habitats, and improve water quality. The Conservancy 

[12:2:58,582] also balances these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally 

[12:3:58,591] sound manner by acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 

[12:4:58,609] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is a 1997 

[12:5:58,618] agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, 

[12:6:58,627] and various private entities to commit $908 million over 10 years to a list of acquisition and capital improvement projects 

[12:7:58,636] needed to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of 

[12:8:58,645] projects, modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was finalized in 

[12:9:58,654] July 2009. 

[13:0:58,672] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay 

[13:1:58,681] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:58,259] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:0:58,286] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 

[8:0:58,304] The California Tahoe Conservancy performs day-to-day management and maintenance of the lands it has acquired, as well 

[8:1:58,313] as the completion of corrective and restorative actions needed to fully achieve the purposes of the acquisitions. It is 

[8:2:58,322] envisioned that the Conservancy ultimately will acquire up to 6,000 environmentally sensitive parcels under existing criteria. 

[8:3:58,331] To date nearly 4,900 parcels, totaling nearly 6,500 acres, have been acquired. These parcels are being managed to 

[8:4:58,340] maintain and/or restore their natural functions, provide for public safety, and provide for open spaces. 

[8:5:58,358] The Conservancy has also acquired additional parcels where more extensive site improvements or more active ultimate 

[8:6:58,367] uses are envisioned. For example, the management objectives for the public access and recreation lands are to allow for: 

[8:7:58,376] suitable and appropriate interim uses during the site improvement planning and implementation process, design and 

[8:8:58,385] construction of public access facilities, and long-term management. 

[9:0:58,403] In addition, high rates of tree mortality (25 percent-40 percent) throughout the Basin have required special emphasis on 

[9:1:58,412] forest resource management activities to reduce fuel hazards, remove hazardous conditions, start corrective actions to 

[9:2:58,421] manage forest health through a variety of means, and limit public liability. Activities include the removal of diseased, dead 

[9:3:58,430] and dying trees to promote forest health while reducing the risk of fire that would destroy property and habitat, threaten lives, 

[9:4:58,439] and diminish the water quality and other resource values of Lake Tahoe. 

[10:0:58,457] The program also provides grants to local governments to improve the Lake's water quality by controlling soil erosion caused 

[10:1:58,466] by existing development, primarily along roadways, and to treat sediment-laden runoff. These projects involve acquisitions 

[10:2:58,475] and site improvements such as the revegetation of barren slopes, and building roadside and storm drainage facilities and 

[10:3:58,484] sediment basins. 

[11:0:58,502] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 

[12:0:58,520] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 

[12:1:58,529] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 

[12:2:58,538] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and 

[12:3:58,547] watersheds such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.

[2:0:58,89] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[3:0:58,108] The Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife 

[3:1:58,117] habitat, watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary 

[3:2:58,126] implementer of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake 

[3:3:58,135] Tahoe Basin - a 1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal 

[3:4:58,144] government, local governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined 

[3:5:58,153] estimates of projects, modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was 

[3:6:58,162] finalized in July 2009. Based on the 2008-2018 EIP, the Conservancy has identified its own EIP project list for new funding.

[5:0:199,238] 3340 California Conservation Corps 

[5:1:58,259] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires, 

[5:2:58,268] floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation 

[5:3:58,277] measures at public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic 

[5:4:58,286] skills to become strong workers and citizens. 

[6:0:58,304] In addition to the CCC, there are also 13 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state 

[6:1:58,313] that are annually certified by the California Conservation Corps, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, 

[6:2:58,322] education, and training activities. 

[7:0:58,340] Because CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to support 

[7:1:58,349] this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:58,256] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[7:0:58,274] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 8 residential and 18 non-residential 

[7:1:58,283] facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities help the CCC achieve its mission of providing employment, training, 

[7:2:58,292] and educational opportunities to young men and women, and assisting federal, state and local agencies, and nonprofit 

[7:3:58,301] entities with the conservation of California's natural resources. 

[8:0:58,319] The CCC residential facilities house 80-100 corpsmembers and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people together 

[8:1:58,328] from across the state, increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential centers range 

[8:2:58,337] in size from 30-60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

[9:0:58,322] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:58,350] 2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 

[11:0:58,368] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 

[11:1:58,377] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety 

[11:2:58,386] and the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by 

[11:3:58,395] federal, state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed 

[11:4:58,404] decisions about land use, seismic safety, and mineral development. 

[11:5:58,422] 2425 - OIL, GAS, AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES 

[12:0:58,440] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to protect the 

[12:1:58,449] environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety. The state is fully reimbursed for program expenditures by annual 

[12:2:58,458] assessments and fees on the respective industries. Approximately 450 companies operate over 88,000 wells in California for 

[12:3:58,467] the production of oil, natural gas, and geothermal resources. 

[12:4:58,485] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 

[13:0:58,503] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. Under the Land 

[13:1:58,512] Conservation Act, landowners who agree to keep their property undeveloped for at least ten years receive lower property tax 

[13:2:58,521] assessments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts 

[13:3:58,530] for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development rights, and therefore 

[13:4:58,539] development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program within the Land Resource 

[13:5:58,548] Protection Program develops maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land 

[13:6:58,557] protection to assist in local land use decisions. 

[13:7:58,575] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 

[14:0:58,593] This program regulates active surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the 

[14:1:58,602] Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to 

[14:2:58,611] reclaim mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned 

[14:3:58,620] mines and remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety. 

[14:4:58,638] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD 

[15:0:58,656] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of 

[15:1:58,665] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The Department's California Geological Survey and the Office of Mine 

[15:2:58,674] Reclamation provide the engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for the reports, plans, and maps which the 

[15:3:58,683] Board approves. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notices of 

[15:4:58,692] violations or orders to comply, and disputes with local lead agencies.

[9:1:58,503] The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the 

[9:2:58,512] property and resources of California. 

[10:0:58,530] CAL FIRE provides all hazard emergency - fire, medical, rescue and disaster - response to the public and provides 

[10:1:58,539] leadership in the protection of life, property and natural resources. 

[11:0:58,557] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life 

[11:1:58,566] safety programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information & education; resource protection; and emergency 

[11:2:58,575] response. 

[12:0:58,593] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 

[12:1:58,602] diverse yet complementary efforts including: training California's fire service professionals; public education and prevention 

[12:2:58,611] awareness; responsible stewardship of our natural resources; and natural resource and emergency management. 

[12:3:58,629] CAL FIRE's highly trained professionals and leaders cultivate mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all 

[12:4:58,638] levels of government and the private sector to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and 

[12:5:58,647] mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wild land areas of California. 

[13:0:58,665] CAL FIRE promotes a culture of innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, planning, workplace safety, and teamwork to 

[13:1:58,674] foster an efficient and effective organizational environment. 

[14:0:58,692] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to 

[14:1:58,701] support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:58,251] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[6:0:58,267] • 

[7:0:68,270] Climate Adaptation Extended Fire Season - The Budget includes $42 million General Fund and $309,000 various special 

[7:1:68,279] funds and reimbursements to expand the state's firefighting capabilities and extend the fire season. Specifically, this 

[7:2:68,288] proposal: (1) adds 42 year-round engines, (2) staffs CAL FIRE engines and helitack bases one month earlier in spring, 

[7:3:68,297] and (3) extends peak staffing in fall by approximately two weeks. These additional resources will also allow CAL FIRE to 

[7:4:68,306] complete a greater number of fuel reduction projects during the off-peak season, helping to reduce the fire risk from 

[7:5:68,315] climate change, drought and tree mortality. 

[8:0:58,330] • 

[9:0:68,333] Drought Legacy and Tree Mortality Response - The Budget includes $38.7 million General Fund and $3 million State 

[9:1:68,342] Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund for expanded fire protection in the 2017 fire season in recognition of continuing 

[9:2:68,351] tree mortality. These funds will support the continuation of firefighter surge capacity, California Conservation Corps fire 

[9:3:68,360] crews, and exclusive use of one large air tanker. In addition, $10 million State Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund is 

[9:4:68,369] available for grants to support local fire prevention activities.

[13:0:58,469] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[14:0:58,497] 2460 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 

[15:0:58,506] The Office of the State Fire Marshal is moving to Program 2461. See description below.  

[15:1:58,524] 2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 

[16:0:58,533] The Office of the State Fire Marshal is responsible for the statewide protection of life and property through the development 

[16:1:58,542] and application of fire protection engineering, education and enforcement. 

[16:2:58,560] 2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) includes the following activities: 

[17:0:58,566] • 

[18:0:68,569] Code Development and Analysis: Objectives include the development and adoption of codes relating to fire/life safety 

[18:1:68,578] used statewide by local fire and building authorities. The Code Development and Analysis Division fosters, promotes and 

[18:2:68,587] develops ways and means of protecting life and property against fire in many ways, including the adoption and 

[18:3:68,596] implementation of regulations for statewide application. This division prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations 

[18:4:68,605] and building standards for review and adoption into the California Code of Regulations, Titles 19 and 24. The division 

[18:5:68,614] assists with the application of state laws, regulations, and code enforcement relating by a city, county, fire departments or 

[18:6:68,623] fire districts, and building departments. This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life 

[18:7:68,632] safety for relevancy, necessity, conflict, duplication and/or overlap. 

[19:0:58,638] • 

[20:0:68,641] Fire and Life Safety: This program is the main entity within the department for the application of laws and regulations 

[20:1:68,650] related to fire prevention and life safety. This is achieved through code compliance inspections of new and existing 

[20:2:68,659] buildings and plan review and construction inspections of state-owned and state-occupied projects. The OSFM is 

[20:3:68,668] responsible for fire & life safety in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, 

[20:4:68,677] conservation camps, community correctional facilities, state mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California 

[20:5:68,686] State University and University of California campuses, and California Agricultural Districts. 

[20:6:68,695] Fire Engineering and Arson and Bomb: The Fire Engineering Division administers licensing programs and provides 

[20:7:68,704] services for product evaluation, certifications and listings. This division also oversees the Arson and Bomb Unit, which has 

[20:8:68,713] the responsibility to dispose seized illegal fireworks and conduct fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement. 

[20:9:68,722] The division is responsible for 11 statewide programs, which include the Building Materials Listing; Portable Fire

[2:3:68,100] product approval, fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement. 

[3:0:58,107] • 

[4:0:68,109] Pipeline Safety: This program regulates approximately 4,800 miles of intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport 

[4:1:68,118] crude oil and refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc.) between offshore platforms, production fields, refineries 

[4:2:68,127] and marine terminals. Regulated pipelines do not include those within production fields, marine terminals or refineries. 

[4:3:68,136] State Fire Training: This program administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System and the Fire 

[4:4:68,145] Service Training and Education Program for federal, state and local firefighters. The program oversees a California Fire 

[4:5:68,154] Academy System for over 50 training academies that represent a partnership with the fire departments, community 

[4:6:68,163] colleges and the OSFM. State Fire Training administers a professional certification system for firefighters and chief 

[4:7:68,172] officers and receives program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services. 

[5:0:58,134] • 

[6:0:58,190] 2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board: 

[7:0:58,199] The Board, created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), works on issues related to the State's "Call 

[7:1:58,208] Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators, except in the case of an emergency, to contact a regional notification 

[7:2:58,217] center, as specified. 

[8:0:58,235] 2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 

[9:0:58,253] CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property and natural resources within social, political and 

[9:1:58,262] economic constraints. The objective is to quickly and aggressively attack all fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed 

[9:2:58,271] primary direct protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial 

[9:3:58,280] attack and follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires 

[9:4:58,289] within the first burning period. 

[10:0:58,307] 2465010 - Fire Prevention: 

[11:0:58,316] This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression 

[11:1:58,325] cost recovery and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials and procedures 

[11:2:58,334] to mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs 

[11:3:58,343] to be done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of fire fighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire 

[11:4:58,352] fighters and damage to the environment. 

[12:0:58,370] 2465019 - Fire Control: 

[13:0:58,379] The objective of this program is to detect, respond and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility 

[13:1:58,388] Area. The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 

[13:2:58,397] 10 acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, 

[13:3:58,406] bulldozers, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. 

[14:0:58,424] 2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 

[15:0:58,433] CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state and federal agencies throughout California 

[15:1:58,442] through the administration of over 100 cooperative government agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing 

[15:2:58,451] agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department. 

[16:0:58,469] 2465037 - Conservation Camps: 

[17:0:58,478] CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Operations and Juvenile 

[17:1:58,487] Justice, operates 39 conservation camps throughout the state that house 196 fire crews. These crews provide one of the 

[17:2:58,496] primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency response, and conservation related work projects. 

[18:0:58,514] 2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 

[19:0:58,523] CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 

[19:1:58,532] with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense 

[19:2:58,541] was incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency 

[19:3:58,550] Management Agency (FEMA) or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may 

[19:4:58,559] recover portions of this cost through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 

[20:0:58,577] 2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 

[21:0:58,595] California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands and urban forests provide multiple human, climate and 

[21:1:58,604] environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to

[1:0:214,44] 3560 State Lands Commission 

[1:1:58,64] The California State Lands Commission serves the people of California by providing stewardship of the lands, waterways, 

[1:2:58,73] and resources entrusted to its care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, 

[1:3:58,82] and the promotion of public access. Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has 

[1:4:58,91] resulted in the generation of over $11 billion in revenues while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those 

[1:5:58,100] lands and resources. 

[2:0:58,118] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State 

[2:1:58,127] Lands Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and 

[2:2:58,136] resources, which the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently 

[2:3:58,145] conveyed to the state by the federal government (commonly known as "school" lands) and oversees the management of 

[2:4:58,154] public trust lands legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of 

[2:5:58,163] the state's tidelands consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced 

[2:6:58,172] from the granted lands back into the trust. 

[3:0:58,190] Public trust or "sovereign" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams 

[3:1:58,199] and lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean 

[3:2:58,208] high tide line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to 

[3:3:58,217] sovereign lands, the Commission manages "school" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government 

[3:4:58,226] under the Act of March 3, 1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands 

[3:5:58,235] include the 16th and 36th sections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or 

[3:6:58,244] previously taken by private claims) and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of 

[3:7:58,253] school lands originally granted to the state, only about 460,370 acres remain in state ownership and these are mostly 

[3:8:58,262] concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000 

[3:9:58,271] acres of sold school lands.

[14:0:58,546] 2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT 

[15:0:58,564] The State Lands Commission oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources that are located on state lands. 

[15:1:58,573] The State also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oils fields, and as such, the Commission participates in 

[15:2:58,582] the safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 

[15:3:58,591] geothermal resources and other minerals; collect revenues generated consistent with the best interests of the state, and 

[15:4:58,600] ensure that public safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development 

[15:5:58,609] of these resources through engineering review, marine facility inspections, and safety audits. The Commission also adopts 

[15:6:58,618] regulations for the prevention of oil spills, the safe operation of offshore facilities and program and financial audits to ensure 

[15:7:58,627] the state receives fair value for the development of its resources. 

[15:8:58,645] 2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT 

[16:0:58,663] The State Lands Commission manages all ungranted state sovereign lands consistent with the common law public trust 

[16:1:58,672] doctrine and prudent land use and management practices. The Commission issues leases and permits for the use and 

[16:2:58,681] occupation of public trust lands under its jurisdiction based upon environmental, economic, health, safety and public benefit 

[16:3:58,690] considerations. The program also manages all state school lands to ensure the greatest economic return to the State 

[16:4:58,699] Teachers' Retirement System. The Commission also oversees the administration of public trust lands legislatively granted to 

[16:5:58,708] local jurisdictions to manage on behalf of the State, including the major ports in the State.

[1:0:179,44] 3560 State Lands Commission - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] The State Lands Commission adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within California, providing 

[2:1:58,82] the best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Commission's Marine Environmental 

[2:2:58,91] Protection Program monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities and reviews, and approves 

[2:3:58,100] all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification programs . The Program also administers Chapter 

[2:4:58,109] 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for purpose. In addition, the Marine 

[2:5:58,118] Environmental Protection Program implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of 

[2:6:58,127] non-indigenous species into California waters through vessel mediated vectors. The program funds and conducts scientific

[4:1:58,212] The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and 

[4:2:58,221] the habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. 

[4:3:58,239] This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to ensure the survival of all species and 

[4:4:58,248] natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational, 

[4:5:58,257] commercial, scientific, and educational uses. 

[5:0:58,275] Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a 

[5:1:58,284] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[6:0:58,260] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[7:0:68,276] • 

[8:0:78,279] Pursuing Collaborative Solutions to Water Supply Reliability and Watershed Health - $1.1 million General Fund and five 

[8:1:78,288] positions for the Department of Fish and Wildlife to provide legal, scientific, and other expertise. Voluntary efforts are 

[8:2:78,297] needed to integrate watershed restoration projects with updated river flow regimes to help salmon and other fisheries 

[8:3:78,306] thrive. Agreements would describe additional water flows and habitat restoration and other measures in the major rivers 

[8:4:78,315] that flow to the Delta. 

[9:0:68,330] • 

[10:0:78,333] Concluding Drought Response - $2.6 million ongoing General Fund to sustain resilient systems for protection of fish 

[10:1:78,342] and wildlife affected by future drought and climate change. During the recent drought, significant investments have 

[10:2:78,351] been made to ensure that the state is better prepared to mitigate the harmful effects of future droughts on fish and 

[10:3:78,360] wildlife resources. These resiliency measures include installation of filtration equipment at fish hatcheries, improved 

[10:4:78,369] water use efficiency at wildlife areas, and a network of fish and wildlife monitoring systems throughout the state.

[6:0:58,286] 2590 - BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROGRAM 

[7:0:58,304] This program encourages the preservation, conservation, maintenance, and restoration of wildlife resources, including the 

[7:1:58,313] Ecosystem Restoration Program, under the jurisdiction and influence of the state. Activities involve the conservation, 

[7:2:58,322] protection and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat to ensure maintenance of biologically sustainable 

[7:3:58,331] populations of those species. 

[8:0:58,349] 2595 - HUNTING, FISHING, AND PUBLIC USE PROGRAM 

[9:0:58,367] This program facilitates diverse and sustainable hunting, fishing (recreational and commercial), trapping, and other public 

[9:1:58,376] uses and associated economic benefits to the state by conserving and managing game species. Activities include collection 

[9:2:58,385] and assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of game fish and wildlife to determine appropriate 

[9:3:58,394] regulations (bag limits, gear restrictions, etc.) and to monitor the effects of those regulations. 

[10:0:58,412] 2600 - MANAGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT LANDS AND FACILITIES PROGRAM 

[11:0:58,430] This program manages Department-owned or leased lands and facilities, including hatcheries, wildlife areas, ecological 

[11:1:58,439] reserves, fish and wildlife laboratories, and public access areas, to contribute to the conservation, protection, and 

[11:2:58,448] management of fish and wildlife. 

[12:0:58,466] 2605 - ENFORCEMENT 

[13:0:58,484] This program serves the public through law enforcement, public safety and hunter education. Law enforcement promotes 

[13:1:58,493] compliance with laws and regulations protecting fish and wildlife resources; investigates habitat destruction, pollution 

[13:2:58,502] incidents and illegal commercialization of wildlife. Wardens also serve the public through general law enforcement, mutual 

[13:3:58,511] aid and homeland security. 

[14:0:58,529] 2610 - COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH PROGRAM 

[15:0:58,547] This program serves the public through resource conservation education and use activities in the classroom and on public 

[15:1:58,556] and private lands, community and stakeholder outreach, and the delivery of information and data using a variety of methods 

[15:2:58,565] including publications, presentations, web applications and media relations. 

[16:0:58,583] 2615 - SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM 

[17:0:58,601] This program prevents damage, minimizes environmental impacts, restores, and rehabilitates California's fish and wildlife 

[17:1:58,610] populations and their habitats from the harmful effects of oil and other deleterious material spills in marine waters and inland 

[17:2:58,619] habitats. 

[18:0:58,637] 2620 - FISH AND GAME COMMISSION 

[19:0:58,655] The California Fish and Game Commission ensures the long term sustainability of California's fish and wildlife resources by 

[19:1:58,664] guiding the ongoing scientific evaluation and assessment of California's fish and wildlife resources; setting California's fish 

[19:2:58,673] and wildlife resource management policies and ensuring these are implemented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife; 

[19:3:58,682] establishing appropriate fish and wildlife resource management rules and regulations; and building active fish and wildlife 

[19:4:58,691] resource management partnerships with individual landowners, the public and interest groups, and federal, state and local 

[19:5:58,700] resource management agencies.

[2:0:58,89] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[3:0:58,108] The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages 742 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres 

[3:1:58,117] (approximately 679,000 acres owned by the state and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the 

[3:2:58,126] Department. Several state agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management 

[3:3:58,135] responsibilities for these properties are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department 

[3:4:58,144] control continues to increase. The properties managed by the Department include: 111 wildlife areas, 136 ecological 

[3:5:58,153] reserves, 138 public access areas, and 20 fish hatcheries.

[13:1:58,627] The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed equally by the Governor, the Senate Rules 

[13:2:58,636] Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 

[13:3:58,645] California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 

[13:4:58,654] recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic 

[14:0:58,663] resources, and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. New development in the coastal 

[14:1:58,672] zone requires a coastal permit either from local government or the Commission. Local governments are required to prepare 

[14:2:58,681] a local coastal program (LCP) for the coastal zone portion of their jurisdiction. After an LCP has been reviewed and 

[14:3:58,690] approved by the Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act, the Commission's regulatory authority over most 

[14:4:58,699] types of new development is delegated to the local government, subject to limited appeals to the Commission. The 

[15:0:58,708] Commission also is designated the principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal 

[15:1:58,717] Coastal Zone Management Act in California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, 

[15:2:58,726] leases, federal development projects, and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not

[13:1:58,634] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 

[13:2:58,643] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 

[13:3:58,652] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 

[13:4:58,661] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to 

[13:5:58,670] the major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 

[13:6:58,679] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 

[13:7:58,688] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 

[13:8:58,697] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 

[13:9:58,706] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 

[13:10:58,715] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by 

[13:11:58,724] providing financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.

[6:0:58,285] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[7:0:58,303] The system consists of 280 parks, beaches, trails, wildlife areas, open spaces, off-highway vehicle areas, and historic sites. 

[7:1:58,312] Parks is responsible for approximately 1.6 million acres of land, including over 343 miles of coastline, 984 miles of lake, 

[7:2:58,321] reservoir and river frontage, approximately 15,000 campsites and alternative camping facilities, and 5,124 miles of non-

[7:3:58,330] motorized trails. 

[8:0:58,348] Over the past five years, Parks has expended approximately $130 million to develop and expand the state park system. 

[8:1:58,357] Parks has accepted gifts and other donations of property and historic structures at no cost to the state when those donations 

[8:2:58,366] made programmatic sense.

[1:0:102,44] 3820 San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission 

[1:1:58,64] The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional 

[1:2:58,73] authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance San Francisco Bay and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive 

[1:3:58,82] use for this and future generations. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan and relies on it, 

[1:4:58,91] the McAteer-Petris Act, and other regulatory authority to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The 

[1:5:58,100] Commission issues permits for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and 

[1:6:58,109] within salt ponds and certain managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh 

[1:7:58,118] Preservation Act of 1977. By state statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management 

[1:8:58,127] Act's program for the Bay and exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The 

[1:9:58,136] Commission leads the ongoing multi-agency regional effort to address the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on 

[1:10:58,145] the Bay and its environs. Funding for these efforts to address climate change is derived mainly from federal grants and other 

[1:11:58,154] agreements, contracts, and reimbursements.

[7:1:58,273] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department 

[7:2:58,282] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs and explores future potential solutions to meet ever-

[7:3:58,291] growing needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also 

[7:4:58,300] works to prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of 

[7:5:58,309] water and its efficient use. 

[8:0:58,327] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program 

[8:1:58,336] to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[11:0:58,218] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[12:0:58,245] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 

[13:0:58,263] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's 

[13:1:58,272] water resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the 

[13:2:58,281] public to consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future 

[13:3:58,290] water conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources 

[13:4:58,299] including water supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water 

[13:5:58,308] uses. The Plan identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as 

[13:6:58,317] conservation, recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem 

[13:7:58,326] restoration, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected 

[13:8:58,335] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare 

[13:9:58,344] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure 

[13:10:58,353] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban 

[14:0:58,362] development, protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water 

[14:1:58,371] Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help 

[14:2:58,380] local agencies and tribal governments improve coordination between water and land use planning. 

[15:0:58,398] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 

[16:0:58,416] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 

[16:1:58,425] 20 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals, 

[16:2:58,434] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 

[17:0:58,452] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities which provide 

[17:1:58,461] water to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 

[18:0:58,479] The Delta Habitat Conservation and Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring 

[18:1:58,488] water supply reliability in a safe, timely, and cost effective manner. This includes development of the Bay Delta Conservation 

[18:2:58,497] Plan, project specific conservation measures, and the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement. 

[19:0:58,515] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 

[20:0:58,533] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures 

[20:1:58,542] proper construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for the construction. Activities 

[20:2:58,551] include assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage 

[20:3:58,560] unwise use of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control 

[20:4:58,569] facilities, coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and 

[21:0:58,578] inspection in cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and 

[21:1:58,587] rights-of-way for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic 

[21:2:58,596] inspection and reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and 

[21:3:58,605] coordination activities associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered 

[21:4:58,614] under this program. The program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies 

[21:5:58,623] with regard to dam safety. 

[22:0:58,641] 3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 

[23:0:58,659] The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC), 

[23:1:58,668] designated floodways and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by 

[23:2:58,677] issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that 

[23:3:58,686] protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-

[23:4:58,695] San Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers 

[23:5:58,704] on large joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies 

[23:6:58,713] that operate and maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public 

[23:7:58,722] forum for stakeholders.

[1:0:159,44] 3860 Department of Water Resources - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] 3255 - SERVICES 

[3:0:58,100] This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning, 

[3:1:58,109] development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory; 

[3:2:58,118] information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 

[3:3:58,136] 3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING 

[4:0:58,154] For a limited period of time, this program purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. Beginning 

[4:1:58,163] January 1, 2003, the utility companies resumed responsibility for purchasing power from the spot market. The utilities, 

[4:2:58,172] however, continued to receive power from the Department's long-term energy contracts with energy suppliers, under which 

[4:3:58,181] the Department retains legal and financial responsibility. All energy contracts signed by the Department have now expired 

[4:4:58,190] or were terminated. However, litigation continues against some of the counterparties to these contracts. Additionally, the 

[4:5:58,199] Department retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering $4.621 billion in revenue bonds issued to repay the 

[4:6:58,208] General Fund for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and funding of reserve accounts necessary 

[4:7:58,217] to maintain an investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.

[8:0:58,403] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

[9:0:58,421] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control 

[9:1:58,430] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage 

[9:2:58,439] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 20 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 

[9:3:58,448] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated 

[9:4:58,457] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate 

[9:5:58,466] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the 

[9:6:58,475] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank 

[9:7:58,484] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, 

[9:8:58,493] weirs, pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more 

[9:9:58,502] flood protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[6:2:58,294] is to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and 

[6:3:58,303] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects 

[6:4:58,312] and enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council 

[6:5:58,321] adopted a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to 

[6:6:58,330] the Delta. Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and 

[6:7:58,339] the other relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta 

[6:8:58,348] Independent Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific 

[6:9:58,357] information to inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
