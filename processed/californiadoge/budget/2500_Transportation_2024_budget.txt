[11:1:285,525] Suisun  

[12:0:66,546] The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses  

[12:1:66,556] and regulates the maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on  

[12:2:66,566] tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton.  

[13:0:66,585] The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident  

[14:0:66,595] investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and  

[14:1:66,605] approving pilotage rates set by an administrative law judge via a hearing process. The seven members of the Board are  

[14:2:66,614] appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio  

[14:3:66,624] member. The Board was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850.  

[15:0:66,644] All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by  

[15:1:66,654] the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost  

[15:2:66,663] of Board operations and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Two separate surcharges are based upon ship movements and  

[15:3:66,673] fund a continuing education program for pilots, and a pilot trainee training program. Two separate surcharges are based on the  

[15:4:66,683] tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the  

[15:5:66,693] San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.
