[0:0:66,13] EDUCATION   2024-25 STATE BUDGET — EDU   1 

[1:0:216,39] 6100   Department of Education  

[2:0:66,60] California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of  

[2:1:66,70] the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6 million  

[3:0:66,79] students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Operations and Administration Branch;  

[3:1:66,89] the Opportunities for All Branch; the Student Achievement Branch; the Student Support Services Branch; the Information and  

[3:2:66,99] Technology Branch; the Instruction, Measurement and Administration Branch; and the Legal, Audits and Charters Branch.  

[4:0:66,116] The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to administer TK-12 education programs, to provide technical  

[4:1:66,126] assistance to local school districts and offices of education and to work with the educational community to improve academic  

[4:2:66,136] performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding local agencies accountable for student achievement in all  

[5:0:66,145] programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity in utilizing a process of continual improvement that enables  

[5:1:66,155] all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and supporting  

[6:0:66,165] teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that promotes  

[6:1:66,175] effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of  

[6:2:66,185] TK-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing broader and more  

[6:3:66,194] effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering systems of school,  

[6:4:66,204] home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help students succeed, (h)  

[6:5:66,214] advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that promotes good business  

[6:6:66,224] practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and  

[6:7:66,233] efficiency of the Department.  

[7:0:66,251] Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital  

[7:1:66,260] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[7:2:66,270] Overview."

[13:1:66,559] K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of  

[13:2:66,569] substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory

[10:0:112,454] 6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System  

[11:0:66,475] The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS).  

[12:0:66,492] The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members'  

[12:1:66,502] creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an  

[12:2:66,512] additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on  

[12:3:66,522] July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three  

[12:4:66,531] years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can adjust the  

[12:5:66,541] state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.  

[13:0:66,558] The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in  

[13:1:66,568] quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing  

[13:2:66,578] power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection  

[13:3:66,588] payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to  

[13:4:66,597] set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to  

[13:5:66,607] CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an  

[13:6:66,617] amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding  

[13:7:66,627] calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15  

[13:8:66,637] of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’  

[13:9:66,646] Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)  

[13:10:66,656] increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

[15:0:66,655] The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities

[15:2:66,674] Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 

[16:0:66,694] The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility  

[16:1:66,704] Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42.5 billion in  

[16:2:66,713] statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.   These funds primarily

[6:0:66,304] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[7:0:66,323] 5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS  

[8:0:66,342] This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure  

[8:1:66,352] a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students.  

[9:0:66,372] The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 280,000 applications annually for  

[9:1:66,381] credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the  

[9:2:66,391] primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential  

[9:3:66,401] personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued.  

[10:0:66,421] The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas,  

[10:1:66,430] aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including  

[10:2:66,440] the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and  

[10:3:66,450] development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the  

[10:4:66,460] Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to  

[10:5:66,469] monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of  

[10:6:66,479] program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program  

[10:7:66,489] approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated  

[10:8:66,499] assignments in collaboration with county offices of education.  

[11:0:66,518] The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal  

[11:1:66,528] advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of  

[11:2:66,538] Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and  

[11:3:66,548] applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct  

[11:4:66,557] disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions.  

[12:0:66,575] 5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES  

[13:0:66,592] This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline  

[13:1:66,602] cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process.  

[14:0:66,619] 5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT  

[15:0:66,636] The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher  

[15:1:66,646] preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface.  

[16:0:66,663] 5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS  

[17:0:66,681] This program supports development and implementation of   Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation  

[17:1:66,690] programs that lead to a teaching or administrative services credential.   In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are  

[17:2:66,700] prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be  

[17:3:66,710] included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment.  

[18:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:498,13] EDUCATION 

[2:0:186,32] 6440   University of California - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic  

[3:1:66,78] programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service.  

[4:0:66,96] The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of  

[4:1:66,105] 1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the UC. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 members:  

[4:2:66,115] 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, and 1 student  

[4:3:66,125] appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents.  

[5:0:66,142] The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. The  

[5:1:66,152] UC also serves students at all levels of higher education in California and serves as the public segment primarily responsible  

[5:2:66,162] for awarding doctoral degrees and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law.  

[6:0:66,179] There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa  

[6:1:66,189] Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education.  

[6:2:66,198] The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and  

[6:3:66,208] administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States  

[6:4:66,218] Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories.  

[6:5:66,235] The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource  

[6:6:66,245] allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated  

[6:7:66,255] authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

[15:1:66,468]  Campus-based fees vary by campus; values shown here are averages on a weighted basis using campus enrollment. Campus-based fees for 2023-24 have not yet been determined and reflect a five-percent increase  

[15:2:64,476] from 2022-23 levels. Campus-based fees do not include waivable health insurance fees. Waivable health insurance fees average $2,647 for undergraduate students and $5,118 for graduate students in 2022-23.

[15:4:66,491]  In July 2021, the UC Board of Regents approved a multi-year Tuition Stability Plan that affects Tuition, the Student Services Fee, and Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (NRST). For undergraduate students  

[15:5:64,498] entering fall 2022 and later, the three charges will be assessed on a cohort basis. For graduate students, the three charges will continue to be assessed on a uniform basis. The 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25  

[15:6:64,506] amounts for undergraduate students, as shown in the display, reflect student fee levels for the cohort entering fall 2022, fall 2023, and fall 2024, respectively. Undergraduate students who started prior to fall 2022  

[15:7:64,513] will continue to pay 2021-22 rates through 2026-27 for Tuition, the Student Services Fee, and NRST. Their total charges in 2022-23 are $14,137 and $43,891 for resident and nonresident students, respectively;  

[15:8:64,520] their total charges in 2023-24 are $14,198 and $43,952 for resident and nonresident students, respectively; and their projected total charges in 2024-25 are $14,279 and $44,033   for resident and nonresident  

[15:9:64,528] students, respectively.
[16:0:64,536] 3 

[16:1:66,537]  Professional Degree Supplemental Tuition levels for 2024-25 have not yet been determined; the figures shown here are unchanged from 2023-24 levels.

[7:0:158,284] 6445   California Institute for Regenerative Medicine  

[7:1:66,305] The mission of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is to accelerate world class science to deliver  

[7:2:66,314] transformative regenerative medicine treatments to a diverse California and worldwide in an equitable manner. The Institute  

[7:3:66,324] was established pursuant to the November 2004 voter-approved Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures  

[7:4:66,334] Act, providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for grants and loans for stem cell research conducted at California  

[7:5:66,344] universities, research institutions, and companies. In November 2020, voters approved Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research  

[7:6:66,354] Institute Bond Initiative, authorizing $5.5 billion in new general obligation bonds to continue regenerative medicine research.  

[7:7:66,371] Proposition 14 also requires that revenues generated through licensing or self-commercializing an invention or technology that  

[7:8:66,381] arises from research funded by CIRM be used to offset the costs of providing treatments and cures arising from CIRM-funded  

[7:9:66,390] research to California patients who have insufficient means to purchase such treatment or cure, including the reimbursement of  

[7:10:66,400] patient-qualified costs for research participants.  

[8:0:66,417] The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 35-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public  

[8:1:66,427] officials appointed on the basis of   their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research  

[8:2:66,437] institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.

[11:0:164,500] 6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants  

[12:0:66,521] This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their  

[12:1:66,531] dependents.  

[13:0:66,548] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan.  

[13:1:66,558] Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed.  

[13:2:66,575] The 2023-24 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established  

[13:3:66,585] in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members  

[13:4:66,595] hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest  

[13:5:66,604] health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also  

[13:6:66,614] contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents.  

[13:7:66,631] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[13:8:66,641] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2023 monthly contribution  

[13:9:66,651] maximums are $883 for a single enrollee, $1,699 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $2,124 for an enrollee and two or  

[13:10:66,661] more dependents. The 2024 monthly contribution maximums are $983 for a single enrollee, $1,890 for an enrollee and one  

[13:11:66,671] dependent, and $2,366 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

[6:0:122,212] 6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges  

[7:0:66,233] The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to  

[7:1:66,243] California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 18 voting members as  

[7:2:66,252] specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-year terms, and must  

[7:3:66,262] include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-year terms and  

[7:4:66,272] include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of  

[7:5:66,282] the Board.  

[8:0:66,299] The objectives of the Board are to:  

[9:0:66,316] • Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.  

[10:0:66,326] • Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.  

[11:0:66,336] • Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.  

[12:0:66,353] Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a  

[12:1:66,363] related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see
