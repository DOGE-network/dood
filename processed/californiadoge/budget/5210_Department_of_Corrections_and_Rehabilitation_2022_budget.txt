[17:0:66,441] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[18:0:65,460] • Adult Incarcerated and Parolee Population—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the adult incarcerated average  

[18:1:76,471] daily population is projected to decrease by 13,882 in 2021-22 and 10,540 in 2022-23, to a total of 99,590 and 102,932,  

[18:2:76,481] respectively. The 2021-22 decline is primarily due to actions taken to reduce the prison population in response to the  

[18:3:76,491] COVID-19 Pandemic, and the 2022-23 decline is due to anticipated reductions to intake in comparison to the 2021 Budget  

[18:4:76,501] Act assumption. Compared to 2021 Budget Act projections, the average daily parolee population is projected to decrease by  

[18:5:76,511] 842 in 2021-22, followed by a decrease by 4,220 parolees in 2022-23, totaling 53,373 and 49,495, respectively. The decline  

[18:6:76,522] in 2022-23 is related to an overall decrease in the incarcerated population and shorter parole terms. When compared to the  

[18:7:76,532] projected average daily population at the 2021 Budget Act, these changes result in a decrease of $102.9 million General  

[18:8:76,542] Fund in 2021-22, and a decrease of $100.6 million General Fund in 2022-23.  

[19:0:65,558] • Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) Population—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the 2022 Budget Act estimates  

[19:1:76,568] an average daily population of 641 youth in 2021-22 and 430 youth in 2022-23, which represents an increase of 28 youth in  

[19:2:76,579] 2021-22 and a decrease of 183 youth in 2022-23. Consistent with Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823), and Chapter 18,  

[19:3:76,589] Statutes of 2021 (SB 92), DJJ is scheduled to close on June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Budget reflects a decrease of $4.2  

[19:4:76,599] million General Fund in 2021-22 and a decrease of $25.8 million in 2022-23.  

[20:0:65,615] • Adult Medical and Pharmaceutical Programs—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the population utilized for the  

[20:1:76,625] purposes of the Medical Classification Model is projected to decrease by 5,457 in 2021-22, and decrease by 3,187 in  

[20:2:76,636] 2022-23, for totals of 96,270 and 98,540, respectively. Based on the current Medical Classification Model staffing ratios,  

[20:3:76,646] these changes will result in a decrease of $5 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $1.3   million General Fund in 2022-23.  

[20:4:76,656] Based on current pharmaceutical cost projections, the Budget also includes decreases of $14.9 million General Fund in  

[20:5:76,666] 2021-22 and $17.9   million General Fund in 2022-23.  

[21:0:65,682] • Mental Health Program—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the population requiring outpatient mental health  

[21:1:76,693] treatment is projected to increase by 2,694 in 2021-22 and 3,838 in 2022-23, for totals of 30,798 and 31,942, respectively.  

[21:2:76,703] These changes result in increases of $19.8 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $28.6 million General Fund in 2022-23.

[13:0:66,387] Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post  

[13:1:66,397] release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based  

[13:2:66,407] treatment programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption  

[13:3:66,418] therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp

[18:1:66,608] with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strives to achieve  

[18:2:66,618] this mission by providing cost-effective, timely, and competent care. In addition, Juvenile Health Care Services is responsible  

[18:3:66,628] for overseeing and implementing the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, which uses evidence-based principles of a  

[18:4:66,639] cognitive behavioral treatment program to guide the development of the best program for the unique needs of the youth and

[9:6:66,318] investigations, and critical incident response training.  

[10:0:66,335] 4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION  

[11:0:66,353] The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and  

[11:1:66,363] degree of successful reintegration and release to society of incarcerated people paroled from state prison. The program is  

[11:2:66,373] responsible for providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The  

[11:3:66,384] main components of supervision utilize the California Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model, which incorporates  

[11:4:66,394] evidence-based practices into the Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral  

[11:5:66,404] change to reduce recidivism. Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case  

[11:6:66,414] factors related to the incarcerated person's risk and current service needs.   Case supervision, reassessment, and  

[11:7:66,424] reclassification are regularly scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community.   Other components of  

[11:8:66,435] supervision include the Sex Offender Management Program, which incorporates the containment model strategy as required by  

[11:9:66,445] statute, and Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring for all sex offenders.

[8:3:66,310] addition, at the Governor's request, the Board investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons, reprieves  

[8:4:66,320] and commutations of sentence, including those involving the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court  

[8:5:66,331] that an incarcerated person’s sentence be recalled due to the incarcerated person’s significant health condition.  

[9:0:66,348] For incarcerated youth, the Board of Juvenile Hearings is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from  

[9:1:66,358] the jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Justice to the jurisdiction of the committing court, and disciplinary appeals.

[5:0:66,189] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and  

[5:1:66,199] technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal  

[5:2:66,210] justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety  

[5:3:66,220] Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention,  

[5:4:66,230] intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is  

[5:5:66,240] consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based  

[5:6:66,250] strategies for managing criminal justice populations.  

[6:0:66,268] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a  

[6:1:66,278] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[8:0:215,374] 5420   Prison Industry Authority  

[9:0:66,395] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries  

[9:1:66,406] in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate  

[9:2:66,416] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections  

[9:3:66,426] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee,  

[9:4:66,436] the Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the  

[9:5:66,446] Speaker of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by  

[9:6:66,457] the Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the  

[9:7:66,467] Board.  

[10:0:66,487] CALPIA supports the public safety mission of CDCR by producing incarcerated individuals that have job skills, good work  

[10:1:66,497] habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. CALPIA's work  

[10:2:66,508] programs also help CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative programming for incarcerated individuals.  

[11:0:66,528] CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that  

[11:1:66,538] provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working  

[11:2:66,548] conditions within enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure incarcerated individuals assigned  

[11:3:66,559] therein the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational  

[11:4:66,569] skills; and (3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient  

[11:5:66,579] funds from the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by  

[11:6:66,589] CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its operation. CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
