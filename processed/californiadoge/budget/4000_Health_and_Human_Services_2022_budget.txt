[2:0:107,32] 4140   Department of Health Care Access and Information - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and  

[3:1:66,79] construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of  

[3:2:66,89] providing sustained services to the public.  

[3:3:66,107] 3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE  

[4:0:66,124] The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and  

[4:1:66,135] nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors  

[4:2:66,145] the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating  

[4:3:66,155] access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California.  

[4:4:66,173] 3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 

[5:0:66,190] The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from

[5:2:66,211] data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory  

[5:3:66,221] surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers,  

[5:4:66,231] health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this  

[5:5:66,241] mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and  

[5:6:66,252] analyze prescription drug cost data, hospital supplier diversity data, hospital quality and equity data, and health care payment  

[5:7:66,262] data to improve transparency, inform policy decisions, reduce disparities, and reduce health care costs.

[8:0:66,386] The Department of Aging's mission is to transform aging for individuals, families, and communities by leading innovative  

[8:1:66,397] programs, planning, policies, and partnerships that increase choices, equity, and well-being for all Californians as we age.  

[8:2:66,414] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that  

[9:0:66,424] provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services, administers the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy  

[10:0:66,435] Program that provides individualized counseling to Medicare beneficiaries, and administers and oversees the development and  

[10:1:66,445] expansion of the Aging and Disability Resource Connection program to provide person centered care to older adults and adults  

[10:2:66,455] living with disabilities. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs; it contracts directly with agencies that operate  

[10:3:66,465] the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver and certifies Community-

[10:4:66,475] Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medi-Cal. The Department administers most of these programs through  

[10:5:66,486] contracts with the State's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and  

[11:0:66,496] coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of

[5:0:66,467] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,487] 3890 - NUTRITION  

[6:0:66,504] The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60  

[6:1:66,515] years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the  

[6:2:66,525] isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and  

[6:3:66,535] assistance, employment, and education.  

[6:4:66,553] 3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE  

[7:0:66,573] The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized  

[7:1:66,583] training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also  

[7:2:66,593] promotes transition to unsubsidized employment.  

[7:3:66,611] 3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES  

[8:0:66,629] This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers,  

[8:1:66,639] grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance,  

[8:2:66,649] legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term  

[8:3:66,659] Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support  

[8:4:66,670] necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care  

[8:5:66,680] services appropriate to their needs.

[3:0:66,69] This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides  

[3:1:66,79] personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local  

[3:2:66,89] source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans.  

[3:3:66,107] 3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS  

[4:0:66,124] This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services  

[4:1:66,135] (CBAS) program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social  

[4:2:66,145] care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who  

[4:3:66,155] otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to  

[4:4:66,165] adults 18 years of age or over who are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health  

[4:5:66,175] conditions and/or disabilities. The Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program.

[6:0:207,263] 4265   Department of Public Health  

[7:0:66,284] The California Department of Public Health (DPH) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all Californians  

[7:1:66,294] through the following core activities:  

[7:2:65,312] • Protecting the public from communicable diseases.  

[8:0:65,328] • Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments, and improving social determinants of health and healthy  

[8:1:76,338] communities.  

[9:0:65,355] • Preventing disease, injury, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities by embedding  

[9:1:76,365] health and mental health equity language, tools, and approaches into all public health and partner agency policies, practices,  

[9:2:76,375] programs, systems, and resource allocation.  

[9:3:65,391] • Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.  

[10:0:65,407] • Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to  

[10:1:76,418] guide public health strategies, programs, and actions.  

[11:0:65,434] • Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces.  

[11:1:65,450] • Providing access to quality, population-based health services.  

[12:0:66,468] Because DPH's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support  

[12:1:66,478] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[9:0:176,361] 4300   Department of Developmental Services  

[10:0:66,382] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for  

[10:1:66,393] overseeing the coordination and delivery of services and supports that persons with developmental disabilities need to lead  

[10:2:66,403] more independent and productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy  

[10:3:66,413] and provides leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities and standards within which the  

[10:4:66,423] developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems  

[10:5:66,433] that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies  

[10:6:66,444] known as regional centers as well as through state-operated facilities. The Department, through contracts with the 21 regional  

[10:7:66,454] centers, oversees through audits and other review the coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities;  

[10:8:66,464] provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their  

[10:9:66,474] lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community.  

[11:0:66,492] Because the Department of Developmental Services' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has  

[11:1:66,502] a capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[11:2:66,512] Overview."

[7:0:66,436] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[7:1:66,455] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of facilities under its control,  

[7:2:66,465] including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities  

[7:3:66,475] are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County.  

[7:4:66,493] The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet in 319 buildings on 784 acres. As of  

[7:5:66,503] February 2020, the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former residents  

[7:6:66,514] to community living. The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until disposition of  

[7:7:66,524] the property. The Department is projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR)  

[7:8:66,534] residences that provide acute crisis services in the community. Additionally, the Department is responsible for the maintenance  

[7:9:66,544] of interior finishes and equipment at Canyon Springs, a 57,000-square-foot leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities  

[7:10:66,554] support the Department's mission in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; and  

[7:11:66,565] vocational training for residents with developmental disabilities committed to a state-operated facility.

[9:0:201,422] 4440   Department of State Hospitals  

[10:0:66,443] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is  

[10:1:66,454] to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, by leading innovation and excellence across a  

[10:2:66,464] continuum of care and settings. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health treatment of its  

[10:3:66,474] patients. The Department oversees five state hospitals located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and  

[10:4:66,484] Patton,   and employs nearly 13,000 staff. In addition to the state hospital treatment,   the Department provides services in  

[10:5:66,494] contracted jail-based competency treatment (JBCT), community-based restoration (CBR), subacute-capacity and pre-trial  

[10:6:66,505] felony mental health diversion programs, and the conditional release program (CONREP).  

[11:0:66,522] Because the Department programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[11:1:66,532] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,135] 4410040 - NAPA

[6:1:66,163] five   State Hospitals and is   the oldest California state hospital still in operation.   It has an open style campus with a security  

[6:2:66,173] perimeter.  

[7:0:66,190] DSH-Napa primarily serves the following four patient types: LPS, IST, OMD, and NGI.  

[8:0:66,208] 4410050 - PATTON  

[9:0:66,226] The Department of State Hospitals-Patton opened in 1893 and is located in San Bernardino County. The hospital has an open  

[9:1:66,236] style campus with a security perimeter. CDCR correctional officers provide perimeter security and transportation at DSH-Patton

[10:0:66,264] DSH-Patton primarily serves the following five patient types: LPS, IST, OMD, NGI and female  Coleman   patients from CDCR.  

[11:0:66,282] 4410060 - HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER ACADEMY  

[12:0:66,299] The Department of State Hospitals Police Officer Academy is overseen by the Office of Protective Services, which is a full  

[12:1:66,310] service law enforcement agency that protects the safety and security of the state hospital facilities, staff and patients. The  

[12:2:66,320] Department provides training standards, model programs, cultural competency, program development, and a comprehensive  

[12:3:66,330] training plan to all protective services staff. 

[13:0:66,348] 4420 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM  

[14:0:66,368] The Conditional Release Program is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients.  

[14:1:66,378] Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began operations on

[18:2:66,510] providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators as patients, requiring the  

[18:3:66,520] Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving 58 counties. Current  

[18:4:66,531] statute requires SVPs be conditionally released to their county of domicile and sufficient funding be available to provide

[22:4:66,683] Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center.

[7:5:66,315] Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new  

[7:6:66,325] category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to be an SVP. The Sex Offender Commitment  

[7:7:66,335] Program administers clinical screenings and performs evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for  

[7:8:66,346] an SVP commitment to the Department of State Hospitals upon completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the  

[7:9:66,356] ultimate determination whether an individual is likely to be an SVP and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the

[2:0:99,32] 4700   Department of Community Services and Development - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through  

[3:1:66,79] financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services.  

[4:0:66,97] The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households  

[4:1:66,107] to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related  

[4:2:66,117] emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard  

[4:3:66,127] the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which  

[4:4:66,137] supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used  

[4:5:66,148] along with LIHEAP weatherization related services.  

[5:0:66,165] The Low Income Household Water Assistance Program is designed to provide financial assistance to low-income households  

[5:1:66,175] that pay a high proportion of household income for drinking water and wastewater services, by providing funds to owners or  

[5:2:66,186] operators of public water systems or treatment works to reduce arrearages of, and rates charged to, such households for these  

[5:3:66,196] services.  

[6:0:66,216] The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-

[6:1:66,226] income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants.  

[7:0:66,244] The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides energy efficiency and renewable energy services in low-income  

[7:1:66,254] single-family and multi-family dwellings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs. LIWP projects include  

[7:2:66,265] weatherization and solar photovoltaic systems installations.  

[8:0:66,282] The California Arrearage Payment Program is designed to prevent energy utility disconnections for households experiencing  

[8:1:66,292] financial hardship due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing financial assistance to customer  

[8:2:66,303] accounts in arrears.  

[8:3:66,320] 4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES  

[9:0:66,338] The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community  

[9:1:66,348] organizations to help low-income families achieve and maintain economic security through a broad range of activities. These  

[9:2:66,358] activities include education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health  

[9:3:66,369] and nutritional services. Additionally, CSBG funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-income  

[9:4:66,379] communities.  

[10:0:66,397] The California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax  

[10:1:66,407] credits to boost the income of eligible individuals and families. Since 2017-18,   the Department   has worked with the Franchise  

[10:2:66,417] Tax Board to provide grant opportunities for community-based organizations to increase awareness of CalEITC.

[2:0:170,32] 5160   Department of Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES  

[5:0:66,103] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities through  

[5:1:66,113] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that individuals with  

[5:2:66,123] disabilities may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In  

[5:3:66,133] addition, the Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education,  

[5:4:66,143] behavioral/mental health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of  

[5:5:66,154] Selection process, which gives priority to individuals with the most significant disabilities.  

[6:0:66,171] Individuals with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range  

[6:1:66,181] of services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement,  

[6:2:66,192] supported employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their  

[6:3:66,202] communities. The Department provides Work Incentives Planning services to reduce dependency on public benefits. The  

[6:4:66,212] Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals working in non-

[6:5:66,222] competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment.  

[7:0:66,240] The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and  

[7:1:66,250] auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16 up to  

[7:2:66,260] 22 (depending on their exit from their special education program), including many who may benefit from early career  

[7:3:66,271] development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary  

[7:4:66,281] education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy. 

[8:0:66,298] The Department, through its Business Enterprises Program, provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to  

[8:1:66,309] enable individuals who are blind or visually impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and  

[8:2:66,319] cafeterias. Prevocational, including employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to  

[8:3:66,329] consumers with vision loss to prepare them for independent living.  

[9:0:66,347] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation  

[9:1:66,357] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and  

[9:2:66,367] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.  

[10:0:66,385] The Department, in partnership with the Department of Developmental Services, implements strategic initiatives to increase the  

[10:1:66,395] employment of individuals with disabilities through the Disability Employment Program. The Department initiates a targeted  

[10:2:66,405] marketing campaign and incentivizes employers to hire individuals with disabilities through technical assistance, workplace  

[10:3:66,415] accessibility, and support training.  

[11:0:66,433] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES  

[12:0:66,451] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout  

[12:1:66,461] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently   with full  

[12:2:66,471] inclusion   in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems  

[12:3:66,481] change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion  

[12:4:66,492] services to community-based living, and   transition services to postsecondary life for youth.  

[13:0:66,509] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their  

[13:1:66,520] families, six service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for individuals with  

[13:2:66,530] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for  

[13:3:66,540] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to  

[13:4:66,550] administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a  

[13:5:66,560] TBI state plan, sustainability plan, statewide TBI registry, and needs assessment.  

[14:0:66,578] In addition, the Department expands the capacity of existing TBI sites and stand up new TBI sites in alignment with Home and  

[14:1:66,588] Community-Based Services surrounding transition and diversion through community reintegration, personal care services  

[14:2:66,598] through supported living services, and other supportive services to improve functional capabilities of individuals with TBI.  

[15:0:66,616] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 17 non-profit community-based  

[15:1:66,626] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually  

[15:2:66,637] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low  

[15:3:66,647] vision evaluations/screenings, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills,  

[15:4:66,657] independent living skills training, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.  

[16:0:66,675] Through a partnership with the California Public Utilities Commission’s Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, the  

[16:1:66,685] Department’s Voice Options program provides eligible Californians who are unable to speak, or who have difficulty speaking,  

[16:2:66,695] with a free speech-generating device. The goal of this program is to ensure full and equal telephone communications access  

[16:3:66,705] for all Californians with disabilities.

[1:0:407,13] 2022-23 STATE BUDGET — HHS   193 

[2:0:144,32] 5175   Department of Child Support Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,103] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing  

[4:1:66,113] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and  

[4:2:66,123] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-

[4:3:66,133] D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary  

[4:4:66,143] Assistance for Needy Families block grant.  

[4:5:66,161] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION:  

[5:0:66,179] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating  

[5:1:66,189] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The  

[5:2:66,199] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.  

[5:3:66,217] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:  

[6:0:66,235] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal  

[6:1:66,245] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State  

[6:2:66,255] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts  

[6:3:66,265] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support  

[6:4:66,275] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments  

[6:5:66,286] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program  

[6:6:66,296] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[2:0:166,32] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS  

[5:0:66,103] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support  

[5:1:66,113] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components:  

[6:0:65,130] • California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)  

[7:0:65,147] • Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food  

[7:1:76,157] Assistance Programs  

[8:0:65,173] • Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program  

[9:0:65,189] • County Administration and Automation Projects  

[10:0:65,205] • Disaster Relief  

[11:0:66,223] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to  

[11:1:66,233] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,  

[11:2:66,244] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.  

[12:0:66,261] 4270010 - CalWORKs:  

[13:0:66,279] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is  

[13:1:66,289] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic  

[13:2:66,299] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes  

[13:3:66,310] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet  

[13:4:66,320] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs  

[13:5:66,330] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Parents have the right to choose child care  

[13:6:66,340] among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both  

[13:7:66,350] goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and development services.  

[14:0:66,368] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:  

[15:0:66,386] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term  

[15:1:66,396] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as  

[15:2:66,406] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is  

[15:3:66,416] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social  

[15:4:66,427] Services as authorized by federal and state law.  

[16:0:66,444] The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to relative guardians of children who were  

[16:1:66,454] previously in the foster care system.  

[17:0:66,472] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate  

[17:1:66,482] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in  

[17:2:66,493] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and  

[17:3:66,503] state law.  

[18:0:66,520] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:  

[19:0:65,538] • The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States  

[19:1:76,548] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.  

[20:0:65,565] • The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and  

[20:1:76,575] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States  

[20:2:76,585] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the  

[20:3:76,595] minor.  

[21:0:65,611] • The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human  

[21:1:76,622] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are  

[21:2:76,632] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under  

[21:3:76,642] CalWORKs).  

[22:0:66,660] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of  

[22:1:66,670] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of  

[22:2:66,680] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations  

[22:3:66,690] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits  

[22:4:66,700] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.  

[23:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:166,32] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in  

[3:1:66,79] employment and training activities.  

[4:0:66,97] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution  

[4:1:66,107] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for  

[4:2:66,117] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with  

[4:3:66,127] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a  

[4:4:66,137] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.  

[5:0:66,155] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious  

[5:1:66,165] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity  

[5:2:66,175] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services  

[5:3:66,186] on October 1, 2016.  

[6:0:66,203] 4270020 - Child Care and Development:  

[7:0:66,221] The Child Care Development program reflects services transitioned to the Department of Social Services from the Department  

[7:1:66,231] of Education, effective July 1, 2021. This includes but is not limited to Stages Two and Three of CalWORKS Child Care,  

[7:2:66,241] migrant day care, and Child and Adult Care Food Programs.  

[8:0:66,259] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:  

[9:0:66,277] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled  

[9:1:66,287] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a  

[9:2:66,297] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who  

[9:3:66,307] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.  

[10:0:66,325] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:  

[11:0:66,343] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who  

[11:1:66,353] administer public assistance programs.  

[12:0:66,371] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.  

[13:0:66,388] 4270046 - Disaster Relief:  

[14:0:66,406] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have  

[14:1:66,416] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance  

[14:2:66,427] programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select  

[14:3:66,437] recovery grants.  

[15:0:66,454] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING  

[16:0:66,472] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child  

[16:1:66,482] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and  

[16:2:66,493] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of  

[16:3:66,503] the service delivery system.  

[17:0:66,520] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:  

[18:0:66,538] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in  

[18:1:66,548] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who  

[18:2:66,559] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs  

[18:3:66,569] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,  

[18:4:66,579] and IHSS-Residual Program.  

[19:0:66,597] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:  

[20:0:66,614] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse  

[20:1:66,625] Prevention.  

[21:0:66,642] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and  

[21:1:66,652] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated  

[21:2:66,663] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with  

[21:3:66,673] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and  

[21:4:66,683] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from  

[21:5:66,693] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:419,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:166,32] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is responsible   for implementing continuum of care  

[3:1:66,79] reforms   codified in Chapter 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to  

[3:2:66,89] services without having to change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and  

[3:3:66,99] families in assessment and case planning.  

[4:0:66,117] The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and  

[4:1:66,127] private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for  

[4:2:66,137] children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services  

[4:3:66,148] include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents;  

[4:4:66,158] training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For  

[4:5:66,168] independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the  

[4:6:66,178] biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.  

[4:7:66,196] The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and  

[4:8:66,206] sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and  

[4:9:66,216] services for at risk families and their children.  

[5:0:66,234] The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of abuse, neglect, or financial  

[5:1:66,244] exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary.  

[5:2:66,262] The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health  

[5:3:66,272] and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes  

[5:4:66,282] facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components.  

[5:5:66,300] 4275028 - Special Programs:  

[6:0:66,318] These programs include but are not limited to programs such as Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance,  

[6:1:66,328] Access Assistance to the Deaf,   Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services, and Legal Services for  

[6:2:66,338] Unaccompanied and Undocumented Minors.  

[6:3:66,356] 4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES  

[7:0:66,373] The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and  

[7:1:66,384] provide administrative services to other agencies.  

[7:2:66,401] 4285010 - Disability Evaluation:  

[8:0:66,419] The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents  

[8:1:66,429] applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of  

[8:2:66,439] the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and  

[8:3:66,450] overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.  

[8:4:66,467] 4285019 - Services to Other Agencies:  

[9:0:66,485] In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative  

[9:1:66,495] services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human  

[9:2:66,505] Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public  

[9:3:66,516] information services.

[7:1:66,291] increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment  

[7:2:66,301] provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT  

[4:0:66,105] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve  

[4:1:66,115] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability  

[4:2:66,126] for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage  

[4:3:66,136] cost-effective approaches to providing services.  

[5:0:66,156] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[5:1:66,166] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts  

[5:2:66,177] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified  

[5:3:66,187] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to  

[5:4:66,197] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision  

[5:5:66,207] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for  

[5:6:66,217] county health and social services programs.

[13:3:66,687] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is  

[13:4:66,697] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and
