[11:0:66,473] The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides  

[11:1:66,483] centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and  

[11:2:66,493] construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building;  

[11:3:66,503] printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's  

[11:4:66,514] vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve  

[11:5:66,524] California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions.  

[12:0:66,544] Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support

[5:0:66,230] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,250] 6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES  

[7:0:66,270] With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for  

[7:1:66,280] inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in  

[7:2:66,290] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds  

[7:3:66,301] are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public  

[7:4:66,311] building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school  

[7:5:66,321] districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)  

[7:6:66,331] Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.  

[8:0:66,349] 6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[9:0:66,367] The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and  

[9:1:66,377] equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties.  

[10:0:66,394] 6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES  

[11:0:66,415] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid  

[11:1:66,425] redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate  

[11:2:66,435] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring   protection of lives and  

[11:3:66,445] property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified  

[11:4:66,456] parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their  

[11:5:66,466] programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies,  

[11:6:66,476] and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and  

[11:7:66,486] ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners.  

[12:0:66,504] 6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES  

[13:0:66,524] To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are  

[13:1:66,535] essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and  

[13:2:66,545] leveraged procurement agreements for   information   technology   and non-information technology   goods and services, green and  

[13:3:66,555] sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing  

[13:4:66,565] small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing  

[13:5:66,575] the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include  

[13:6:66,586] travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy  

[13:7:66,596] efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human resources services.  

[13:8:66,606] Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct quasi-judicial hearings  

[13:9:66,616] and mediations authorized by law.  

[14:0:66,634] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[15:0:66,654] The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This  

[15:1:66,664] program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services,  

[15:2:66,675] auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative  

[15:3:66,685] services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training,   information technology, health and safety, and  

[15:4:66,695] departmental procurement and contracting.

[7:2:76,368] to backfill the decline in revenues in the Restitution Fund. This funding will enable the Victim Compensation Board to  

[7:3:76,378] continue providing vital compensation payments to victims.  

[8:0:65,395] • Reparations for Victims of Forced Sterilization—The Budget includes $7.5 million one-time General Fund to establish the  

[8:1:76,405] Forced or Involuntary Sterilization Compensation Program to provide compensation   for individuals who were sterilized  

[8:2:76,415] pursuant to eugenics laws between 1909 and 1979, or sterilized while imprisoned after 1979.

[5:0:66,141] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,160] 6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,180] This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer  

[6:1:66,190] financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a  

[6:2:66,201] claim with the CalVCB for program benefits.  

[6:3:66,218] 6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,239] This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery  

[7:1:66,249] of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community  

[7:2:66,259] (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition  

[7:3:66,269] and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,  

[7:4:66,280] the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.  

[7:5:66,297] 6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,318] This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that  

[8:1:66,328] benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

[8:2:66,317] survivor retirement benefits.  

[9:0:66,337] CalPERS provides health benefits for approximately 1,513,000 active and retired state, local government, and school  

[9:1:66,347] employees and their family members as of June 30, 2020. CalPERS develops, negotiates, and administers contracts with

[6:0:66,244] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[7:0:66,264] • The Budget includes $1.9 billion Proposition 2 debt repayment funding for a supplemental pension payment in 2021-22 to  

[7:1:66,274] further reduce the state’s CalPERS unfunded liability. This is a supplemental payment in addition to the estimated $6 billion  

[7:2:66,284] contribution the state is statutorily-required to make to CalPERS in 2021-22. Based on current projections, an additional $5.5  

[7:3:66,294] billion in Proposition 2 funding is planned to be paid to CalPERS over the remaining forecast period (fiscal years 2022-23 to  

[7:4:66,304] 2024-25) depending on the future availability of those funds.  

[8:0:66,322] • Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $225 million within the  

[8:1:66,332] Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s portion of a loan from the Surplus Money  

[8:2:66,342] Investment Fund. This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement  

[8:3:66,353] plans in 2017-18.

[11:0:95,341] 1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2021-22 Governor's Budget. 

[12:0:95,362] 2/ This display does not reflect the $1.9 billion supplemental pension payment to the California Public Employees' Retirement  

[12:1:95,373] System (CalPERS) in 2021-22 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in the 2021 Budget 

[12:2:95,382] Act, nor does it reflect the supplemental pension payments to the CalPERS state plans and Schools Pool that are included in  

[12:3:95,392] the 2019 Budget Act. Chapter 33, Statutes of 2019 (SB 90) authorized a $3 billion supplemental pension payment to be paid to  

[12:4:95,402] CalPERS over fiscal years 2018-19 through 2022-23, and Chapter 859, Statutes of 2019 (AB 118) authorized a $100 million  

[12:5:95,411] supplemental pension payment to be paid to CalPERS over fiscal years 2019-20 through 2022-23. The following changes were  

[12:6:95,421] implemented as part of the Budget Act of 2020: (1) remove the General Fund payments scheduled over fiscal years 2020-21  

[12:7:95,430] through 2022-23, (2) pay the scheduled $243 million 2020-21 General Fund payment to the state patrol member plan using  

[12:8:95,440] Proposition 2 debt repayment funding, and (3) redirect the $2.5 billion transferred in 2019 to produce the most immediate  

[12:9:95,449] savings (over fiscal years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22). 

[13:0:95,466] 3/ The 2021 Budget Act estimates 2021-22 state contributions to CalPERS to be $6,039,662,000. The decrease in this estimate  

[13:1:95,477] from the 2021-22 Governor's Budget to the 2021 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans' employer contribution  

[13:2:95,487] rate, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2021 meeting. 

[14:0:95,510] 4/ The 2021 Budget Act estimates 2021-22 administrative expenditures to be $433,175,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board  

[14:1:95,521] of Administration at its April 2021 meeting. The decrease to this estimate from the 2021-22 Governor's Budget to the 2021  

[14:2:95,531] Budget Act reflects the net of the savings approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its November 2020 meeting  

[14:3:95,540] and anticipated increases in salary and benefits captured in the expenditures approved in April 2021.
[15:0:95,563] 5/ The 2021 Budget Act estimates 2021-22 other expenditures to be $1,030,261,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of  

[15:1:95,574] Administration at its April 2021 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2021-22 Governor's Budget to the 2021 Budget  

[15:2:95,584] Act is primarily due to an increase in investment external management fees and third party adminstrator fees.

[1:0:433,13] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:143,32] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 6410 - RETIREMENT  

[5:0:66,105] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for  

[5:1:66,115] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of  

[5:2:66,126] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2020, there were about 1,320,000 active and inactive members, and  

[5:3:66,136] about 733,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.  

[6:0:66,156] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  

[6:1:66,166] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,  

[6:2:66,177] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract  

[6:3:66,187] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit  

[6:4:66,197] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.  

[7:0:66,217] As of June 30, 2020, there were 2,890 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and  

[7:1:66,228] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their  

[7:2:66,238] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency  

[7:3:66,248] retirement systems.  

[8:0:66,268] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.  

[9:0:66,286] 6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY  

[10:0:66,307] CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the  

[10:1:66,317] federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age,  

[10:2:66,327] Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.   As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the  

[10:3:66,337] liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.   The program is responsible for  

[10:4:66,347] administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting  

[10:5:66,358] and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 

[11:0:66,375] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS  

[12:0:66,396] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee  

[12:1:66,406] associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees,  

[12:2:66,416] retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs,  

[12:3:66,426] provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer  

[12:4:66,436] representatives.  

[13:0:66,457] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,  

[13:1:66,467] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all  

[13:2:66,477] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial  

[13:3:66,487] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.  

[14:0:66,505] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS  

[15:0:66,526] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the  

[15:1:66,536] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired  

[15:2:66,546] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'  

[15:3:66,556] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $395.8 billion, as of June 30, 2020.  

[16:0:66,574] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,594] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of  

[17:1:66,604] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy  

[17:2:66,615] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term  

[17:3:66,625] Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

[8:0:206,361] 7910   Office of Administrative Law  

[9:0:66,382] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state  

[9:1:66,392] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these  

[9:2:66,403] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also  

[9:3:66,413] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been  

[9:4:66,423] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through  

[9:5:66,433] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative  

[9:6:66,443] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members  

[9:7:66,454] of the public regarding California rulemaking law.  

[10:0:66,474] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies  

[10:1:66,484] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the  

[10:2:66,494] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.  

[11:0:66,515] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the  

[11:1:66,525] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[10:0:66,465] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[11:0:66,485] • The Budget includes $12.3 million for 30 positions and funding for external investment audit services to continue building  

[11:1:66,495] inhouse investment capabilities and the benefits of internally managed assets, and manage overall growth of assets under  

[11:2:66,505] management. The funding and positions in 2021-22 represent the first year of a multi-year strategy for these efforts in the  

[11:3:66,515] amount of $40.9 million and 109 positions, distributed across fiscal years 2021–22 through 2025–26.  

[12:0:66,533] • The Budget includes $3.9 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The roughly $435 million increase from the  

[12:1:66,543] previous fiscal year is largely due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its authority to  

[12:2:66,553] increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law in 2014. See  

[12:3:66,564] 6300 - State Contribution to the State Teachers' Retirement System for more information.  

[13:0:66,581] • The Budget includes a $410 million supplemental pension payment in 2021-22 towards the state's share of the Defined  

[13:1:66,592] Benefit Program's unfunded liability to be paid out of Proposition 2 debt funding. See 6300 - State Contribution to the State

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS  

[4:0:66,105] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the  

[4:1:66,115] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the  

[4:2:66,126] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement  

[4:3:66,136] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may  

[4:4:66,146] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the  

[4:5:66,156] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's  

[4:6:66,166] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or  

[4:7:66,177] contract provisions.  

[5:0:66,197] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the  

[5:1:66,207] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of  

[5:2:66,217] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
