[10:1:66,602] match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an internet labor exchange system to facilitate  

[10:2:66,612] this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to  

[10:3:66,623] provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans,  

[10:4:66,633] youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited

[3:1:66,89] Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit  

[3:2:66,99] programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction.  

[3:3:66,117] 5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,137] The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California  

[4:1:66,148] workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income  

[4:2:66,158] replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  

[4:3:66,175] 5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,196] The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing  

[5:1:66,206] monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take  

[5:2:66,216] time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-

[5:3:66,226] law or to bond with a new minor child, or to participate in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to  

[5:4:66,237] covered active duty of the individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States.  

[5:5:66,254] 5930 - TAX PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,272] The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax  

[6:1:66,282] collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support  

[6:2:66,292] the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs.  

[6:3:66,310] 5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL  

[7:0:66,328] The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including  

[7:1:66,338] small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages  

[7:2:66,348] and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention  

[7:3:66,358] and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes  

[7:4:66,369] special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout  

[7:5:66,379] the state.  

[8:0:66,397] 5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  

[9:0:66,417] The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment  

[9:1:66,427] Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide  

[9:2:66,437] and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California SM   in local  

[9:3:66,451] communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce,  

[9:4:66,462] veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to  

[9:5:66,472] job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention,  

[9:6:66,482] earnings, and occupational skills of participants.  

[9:7:66,500] 5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS  

[10:0:66,520] The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as the National Emergency Grant Program,  

[10:1:66,530] consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due  

[10:2:66,541] to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to  

[10:3:66,551] react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

[5:0:66,167] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,187] 6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD  

[7:0:66,207] The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the  

[7:1:66,217] Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public  

[7:2:66,227] sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and  

[7:3:66,238] dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by  

[7:4:66,248] the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial   courts.  

[8:0:66,268] The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to:  

[9:0:65,286] • Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively  

[9:1:76,296] represent them in their labor relations with their employer.  

[10:0:65,312] • Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees,  

[10:1:76,322] and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws.  

[10:2:65,339] • Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings.  

[10:3:65,355] • Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it  

[10:4:76,365] administers.  

[11:0:66,393] OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL  

[12:0:66,413] The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and  

[12:1:66,424] presiding over informal settlement conferences. The Office of the General Counsel also oversees the statutory process through  

[12:2:66,434] which employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their  

[12:3:66,444] employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains  

[12:4:66,454] enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions.  

[13:0:66,475] DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW  

[14:0:66,495] The Division of Administrative Law conducts adjudicative proceedings, which includes the presentation of evidence and  

[14:1:66,505] examination of witnesses under oath. Proposed decisions are issued consisting of written findings of fact and legal conclusions.  

[15:0:66,526] STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE  

[16:0:66,546] The State Mediation and Conciliation Service was established in 1947 to promote harmonious labor/management relations in  

[16:1:66,556] California and became a division of PERB on July 1, 2012. The division mediates labor disputes between employers and  

[16:2:66,566] employee organizations, conducts consent elections, and performs other representation-related work. In addition, the division  

[16:3:66,577] provides lists of arbitrators, interpersonal workplace conflict resolution mediation, and training on a variety of collective  

[16:4:66,587] bargaining processes.  

[17:0:66,607] DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATION  

[18:0:66,628] The Division of Administration supports operations by facilitating and managing the budget, human resources management,  

[18:1:66,638] business services, procurement and contracting, fiscal accountability, information technology infrastructure, and other  

[18:2:66,648] administrative needs.

[7:1:66,643] employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is  

[7:2:66,653] actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-

[7:3:66,663] sector employer post a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer  

[7:4:66,674] defaults on its obligations.

[3:0:66,69] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize  

[3:1:66,79] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides  

[3:2:66,89] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits.  

[3:3:66,99] The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system  

[3:4:66,109] required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured  

[3:5:66,120] Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and  

[3:6:66,130] sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system  

[3:7:66,140] designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system.  

[3:8:66,150] Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical  

[3:9:66,160] Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-

[3:10:66,171] based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by  

[3:11:66,181] identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system.  

[4:0:66,199] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'  

[5:0:66,209] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court,  

[5:1:66,219] and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.  

[6:0:66,237] 6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[7:0:66,254] The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for monitoring the workers’ compensation  

[7:1:66,265] and health and safety program. This involves conducting continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the  

[7:2:66,275] state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and occupational diseases, which includes making recommendations on how to  

[7:3:66,285] improve the workers' compensation and health and safety program, as well as maintaining the occupational safety and health  

[7:4:66,295] training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services coordinator. The Commission conducts  

[7:5:66,305] specified surveys and evaluations required by law and issues an annual report on the state of the workers' compensation  

[7:6:66,316] system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications. The Commission also issues, if necessary, a  

[7:7:66,326] report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices required to be provided by insurers and self-

[7:8:66,336] insured employers.  

[8:0:66,354] 6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  

[9:0:66,371] The Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) promotes and enforces the sections of the Labor Code that protect  

[9:1:66,382] the health and safety of workers on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways,  

[9:2:66,392] and pressure vessels for the benefit of the general public. The coordinated efforts of Cal/OSHA, the Occupational Safety and  

[9:3:66,402] Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (Appeals Board)  

[9:4:66,412] accomplish these objectives.  

[10:0:66,430] Cal/OSHA enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries and  

[10:1:66,440] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. Cal/OSHA conducts inspections and issues permits for the  

[10:2:66,450] operation of elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways and pressure vessels. The  

[10:3:66,460] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these  

[10:4:66,471] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, Cal/OSHA also obtains and maintains job safety  

[10:5:66,481] records, reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and  

[10:6:66,491] provides accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by  

[10:7:66,501] state and local government.  

[11:0:66,519] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as  

[11:1:66,529] follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor,  

[11:2:66,539] one member from the field of occupational health and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in  

[11:3:66,550] the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards  

[11:4:66,560] enforced by Cal/OSHA.  

[12:0:66,577] The Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations and  

[12:1:66,588] accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by Cal/OSHA for occupational safety and health standards violations. It is  

[12:2:66,598] comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from  

[12:3:66,608] the field of management and one member from the field of labor.  

[13:0:66,626] 6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT  

[14:0:66,643] The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (Labor Commissioner’s Office) interprets and enforces the sections of the Labor  

[14:1:66,654] Code which relate to wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees  

[14:2:66,664] engaged in protected activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders. This work is conducted  

[14:3:66,674] by providing field enforcement of laws governing public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed  

[14:4:66,684] contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the payment of overtime and minimum wage; making wage determinations  

[14:5:66,694] and collecting unpaid wages; the licensing of specific industries; the payment of wages without required deductions;  

[15:0:66,705] administration of the prevailing wage program and enforcement of apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works  

[15:1:66,715] projects. Under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, the Labor Commissioner’s Office conducts vigorous and

[3:1:66,79] "underground economy".  

[4:0:66,97] 6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS  

[5:0:66,114] The Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS) matches the needs of workers with those of employers, and strengthens the  

[5:1:66,124] apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting workers and teaching the skills they and  

[5:2:66,135] their employers need. The goals of DAS are to promote, develop and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs,  

[5:3:66,145] as well as provide consultation services to program sponsors. DAS administers the apprenticeship system in California. This  

[5:4:66,155] includes initial program approval and subsequent oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor  

[5:5:66,165] Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. The  

[5:6:66,175] California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the general  

[5:7:66,186] policy under which this program operates.  

[5:8:66,203] 6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES  

[6:0:66,221] The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers'  

[6:1:66,231] compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required  

[6:2:66,241] under the Labor Code.  

[7:0:66,259] The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor  

[7:1:66,269] Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be  

[7:2:66,280] disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
