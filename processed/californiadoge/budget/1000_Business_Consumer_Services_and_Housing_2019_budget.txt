[1:0:134,43] 2240   Department of Housing and Community Development  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Housing and Community Development's (HCD's) mission is to preserve and expand safe and affordable  

[2:1:66,74] housing opportunities and promote strong communities for all Californians by (1) administering housing finance, economic  

[3:0:66,84] development, and community development programs, (2) developing housing policy and advocating for an adequate housing  

[3:1:66,95] supply, and (3) developing building codes and regulating manufactured homes and mobilehome parks. HCD also provides  

[3:2:66,105] technical and financial assistance to local agencies to support community development.  

[4:0:66,125] The California Housing Finance Agency's (CalHFA's) mission is to create and finance progressive housing solutions so more  

[5:0:66,135] Californians have a place to call home. The Agency's Multifamily Division finances affordable rental housing through public and  

[5:1:66,146] private partnerships, while its Single Family Division provides first mortgage loans and down payment assistance to first-time  

[6:0:66,156] homebuyers. CalHFA, a statutorily independent agency and component unit of state government, is not subject to Budget Act  

[6:1:66,166] appropriation. Effective July 1, 2013, pursuant to the Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 2012, CalHFA is displayed, for  

[6:2:66,176] budgetary purposes only, within HCD's budget, and reports to the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency.

[6:1:65,318] • Local Government Planning Support Grants Program- The Budget allocates $250 million in planning grants to support local

[6:3:65,345] • Infill Infrastructure Grant Program- The Budget allocates $500 million in competitive and over-the-counter grants for qualified  

[6:4:76,355] capital improvement projects (i.e. streets, parking lots, utilities) integral to developing qualifying infill areas or projects. This  

[6:5:76,365] will help remove a barrier to building and spur production in high density areas.   Under this program, local governments and  

[6:6:76,375] developers can partner to apply for infrastructure grants.  

[7:0:65,391] • Moderate-Income Housing Production - The Budget allocates $500 million to CalHFA to develop new low- and moderate-

[7:1:76,402] income housing. This loan program will expand on the Mixed Income Loan Program funded through ongoing SB 2 revenues  

[7:2:76,412] and pair with tax credits targeting households with incomes between 30 and 120 percent Area Median Income.

[6:1:66,487] 1660 - CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,507] The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures designed  

[7:1:66,517] for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State Housing Law,  

[7:2:66,528] Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built Housing Law, and the  

[7:3:66,538] Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act of 1980. HCD works with factory and site-built building industries, stakeholders, and  

[7:4:66,548] other government agencies to review and amend the international building codes as the basis for residential construction in  

[7:5:66,558] order to develop the California Building Standards Code. The program also enforces federal and state standards for the  

[7:6:66,568] construction, safety, sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars.  

[7:7:66,586] 1665 - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,607] The objectives of this program are to: (1) increase housing supply by providing loans and grants to develop and preserve safe  

[8:1:66,617] and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by awarding  

[8:2:66,627] state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and (4) monitor
