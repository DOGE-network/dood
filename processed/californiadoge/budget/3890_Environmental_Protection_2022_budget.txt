[1:0:211,39] 3900   State Air Resources Board  

[2:0:66,61] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes  

[3:0:66,71] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in  

[3:1:66,81] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.  

[4:0:66,91] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans  

[4:1:66,101] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources, fuels, consumer products, and industrial sources  

[5:0:66,112] established by the Board and local air districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility to develop measures to  

[5:1:66,122] reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006  

[5:2:66,132] (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 32). The Air Resources Board oversees an extensive portfolio of incentives  

[6:0:66,142] intended to reduce air pollution (including greenhouse gases), support shifts towards less-polluting transportation options, and  

[6:1:66,152] advance zero emission technologies, among other purposes. The Air Resources Board is also responsible for developing  

[6:2:66,163] guidance for agencies administering California Climate Investments programs to ensure statutory requirements of the  

[7:0:66,173] Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are met, including maximizing benefits for disadvantaged communities, reporting, and  

[8:0:66,183] quantification methods, pursuant to Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014 (SB 862), and serves as the account administrator for the  

[9:0:66,193] Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.   The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce  

[9:1:66,203] air pollution in the State's most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources  

[9:2:66,214] Board works with local air districts, the business community, scientists, community representatives, and other stakeholders to  

[9:3:66,224] implement its programs.  

[10:0:66,244] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay  

[10:1:66,254] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[17:1:66,409] General Fund in 2022-23, and an additional $300 million General Fund in 2023-24 to support the AB 617 program, which  

[17:2:66,420] reduces emissions in communities with disproportionate exposure to air pollution through targeted air monitoring and  

[17:3:66,430] community emissions reduction programs. The Budget also includes $100 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in 2022-23  

[17:4:66,440] to expand the number of satellites launched for methane observations, which would provide weekly measurement of large  

[17:5:66,450] methane emissions in the state and enhance enforcement capabilities.

[18:1:66,478] 98 General Fund, and $383 million federal funds as part of a $6.1 billion package to equitably scale the zero emission vehicle  

[18:2:66,488] market and accelerate the state toward meeting its climate and transportation goals. The remaining $3.5 billion General Fund  

[18:3:66,498] will be allocated in the summer pending additional discussions with the Legislature. This funding builds upon the $3.9 billion of  

[18:4:66,509] investments in the 2021 Budget Act and includes funding to support: zero emission drayage trucks and transit buses; Clean  

[18:5:66,519] Trucks, Buses, and Off-Road Equipment; Clean Cars 4 All and other equity programs; zero emission vehicles around ports;

[2:2:76,117] established procedures.  

[2:3:65,133] • Developing testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuels and fuel additives,  

[2:4:76,143] and testing equipment to ensure emission standards are met.  

[2:5:65,160] • Overseeing incentive programs that provide funding to replace existing vehicles and engines, purchase new vehicles and  

[2:6:76,170] engines, plan and implement improved transportation projects, otherwise upgrade or replace air pollution sources, and  

[2:7:76,180] advance zero emission technologies  

[2:8:66,198] 3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE  

[2:9:66,218] The Stationary Source Program works to reduce emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as  

[2:10:66,228] follows:  

[3:0:65,246] • Developing, implementing, and enforcing measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by  

[3:1:76,256] the California Clean Air Act and working with local air districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient air quality  

[3:2:76,266] standards.  

[4:0:65,283] • Identifying substances that are toxic air contaminants and developing, implementing, and enforcing measures to control toxic  

[4:1:76,293] air contaminant emissions from stationary sources.  

[4:2:66,310] 3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE  

[5:0:66,331] The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, as  

[5:1:66,341] follows:

[5:1:66,624] 3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM  

[5:2:66,642] The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund  

[5:3:66,652] program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,290 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups,  

[5:4:66,662] and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 249 sites where the cleanup process is complete.  

[5:5:66,672] Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,061 land-use restrictions in  

[5:6:66,683] place on properties throughout the state.  

[5:7:66,700] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other  

[5:8:66,711] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to

[3:1:66,79] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military  

[3:2:66,89] installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former  

[3:3:66,99] hazardous waste disposal site.  

[4:0:66,117] The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness  

[4:1:66,127] for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills  

[4:2:66,137] and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.  

[5:0:66,155] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT  

[6:0:66,173] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of  

[6:1:66,183] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at  

[6:2:66,193] 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 800 registered businesses that transport hazardous  

[6:3:66,203] waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300  

[6:4:66,214] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[6:5:66,224] assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of  

[6:6:66,234] the Unified Program.  

[7:0:66,252] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[7:1:66,262] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste  

[7:2:66,272] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused  

[7:3:66,282] enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste  

[7:4:66,292] and used oil.  

[8:0:66,310] 3626 - HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES  

[9:0:66,328] The Hazardous Waste Facilities program oversees the hazardous waste permitted facilities that are permitting for storage,  

[9:1:66,338] treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees the  

[9:2:66,348] maintenance activities and compliance at 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste and approximately 300  

[9:3:66,358] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[9:4:66,369] assurance resources.  

[10:0:66,386] The program monitors permitted hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[10:1:66,397] electronic manifest surveillance, enforcement of hazardous waste requirement violations found through routine inspections;  

[10:2:66,407] complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused enforcement initiatives.  

[11:0:66,424] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS  

[12:0:66,442] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic  

[12:1:66,452] chemicals that are used in consumer products. The SCP program calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by  

[12:2:66,463] identifying safer alternatives that eliminate or reduce the use of hazardous chemicals which may harm people or the  

[12:3:66,473] environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order to identify Priority  

[12:4:66,483] Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the analysis of safer  

[12:5:66,493] alternatives, and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption of "green  

[12:6:66,503] chemistry" practices.  

[13:0:66,521] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY  

[14:0:66,539] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)  

[14:1:66,549] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified  

[14:2:66,559] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for  

[14:3:66,569] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response  

[14:4:66,580] plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements  

[14:5:66,590] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.  

[15:0:66,607] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM  

[16:0:66,625] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities  

[16:1:66,635] surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as closure and corrective action at the facility  

[16:2:66,646] itself. Under the program, the department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including  

[16:3:66,656] residences, schools, daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7-mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated  

[16:4:66,666] soil at those properties with the highest levels of lead in soil and greatest potential for exposure.

[8:0:66,306] The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians   and the state's  

[9:0:66,316] environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support, and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office  

[9:1:66,327] performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as  

[9:2:66,337] other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with scientific tools and information upon which to base risk-

[10:0:66,347] management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing hazards and   health risks, including risks to children and other  

[11:0:66,357] sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, and fish and  

[11:1:66,367] shellfish, as well as health and environmental impacts from climate change. The Office also evaluates community pollution  

[11:2:66,378] burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities and reduce exposures and  

[11:3:66,388] risks to residents.
