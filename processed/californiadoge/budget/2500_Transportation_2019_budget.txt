[3:0:66,119] The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident  

[3:1:66,129] investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and  

[3:2:66,140] providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the  

[3:3:66,150] Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board  

[3:4:66,160] was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850.  

[4:0:66,180] All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by  

[4:1:66,191] the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost  

[4:2:66,201] of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Three separate surcharges are based upon ship movements  

[4:3:66,211] and fund a continuing education program for pilots, a pilot trainee training program, and the acquisition of navigation technology  

[4:4:66,221] for use by pilots. Two separate surcharges are based on the tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay  

[4:5:66,231] and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.

[1:0:202,43] 2740   Department of Motor Vehicles  

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) promotes driver safety by licensing drivers and protects consumers by issuing  

[2:1:66,74] vehicle titles and regulating vehicle sales.  

[3:0:66,95] Because DMV's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, DMV has a capital outlay program to support this need.  

[3:1:66,105] For the specifics on DMV's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[10:0:66,600] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[10:1:65,619] • DMV Operational Improvements — The Budget includes $226 million from multiple fund sources, including $207.7 million  

[10:2:76,629] one-time and up to 1,873.3 temporary positions and $34 million ongoing and 178.8 positions to address both immediate and  

[10:3:76,639] long-term needs within DMV.   Funding will allow DMV to address the anticipated demand for 9.8 million federally compliant  

[10:4:76,649] REAL Driver Licenses and Identification Cards, allow field offices to accept credit cards, upgrade IT equipment and  

[10:5:76,659] functionality, and improve its operational and managerial processes.   The   program change consists of an increase of $242  

[10:6:76,670] million Motor Vehicle Account and a reduction of $9.8 million in other special funds for a   net increase of $234 million.   The  

[10:7:76,680] Budget also removes $8.5 million of the   SB 1 Transportation Funding Governor's Budget proposal   for a total program  

[10:8:76,690] change of $226 million.   These reductions reflect the fiscal impact of passing credit card convenience fees on to DMV  

[10:9:76,700] customers.
