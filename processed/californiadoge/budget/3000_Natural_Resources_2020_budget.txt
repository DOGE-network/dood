[1:0:242,53] 3100   Exposition Park  

[2:0:66,75] The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are  

[2:1:66,85] located in Exposition Park, a 160-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these  

[2:2:66,95] three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park.  

[3:0:66,113] The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park  

[3:1:66,123] usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of  

[3:2:66,133] the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science related learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect,  

[3:3:66,143] preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California  

[3:4:66,154] and the western United States.  

[4:0:66,171] Because   the Science Center's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the   Science Center   has a capital outlay  

[4:1:66,182] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,304] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,323] 2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER  

[7:0:66,344] Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and  

[7:1:66,354] family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops  

[7:2:66,364] and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.  

[8:0:66,384] Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological  

[8:1:66,395] processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,  

[8:2:66,405] communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary  

[8:3:66,415] home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its  

[8:4:66,425] permanent home - is completed.  

[9:0:66,446] In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The  

[9:1:66,456] Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and  

[9:2:66,466] other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a  

[9:3:66,476] Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The  

[9:4:66,486] school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards.  

[10:0:66,507] The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those  

[10:1:66,517] traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding  

[10:2:66,527] support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.  

[11:0:66,545] 2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,563] The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management  

[12:1:66,573] and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events,  

[12:2:66,583] and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is  

[12:3:66,593] responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of  

[12:4:66,603] park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park  

[12:5:66,614] Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in  

[12:6:66,624] addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood.  

[13:0:66,642] 2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM  

[14:0:66,659] The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the  

[14:1:66,669] Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of  

[14:2:66,680] African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African  

[14:3:66,690] American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear  

[14:4:66,700] campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility  

[14:5:66,710] in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,83] programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture,  

[3:1:66,93] historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and  

[3:2:66,103] to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at  

[3:3:66,113] large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty  

[3:4:66,124] years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an  

[3:5:66,134] inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

[6:0:201,273] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy  

[7:0:66,294] The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational  

[7:1:66,305] resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs  

[7:2:66,315] that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed restoration;  

[7:3:66,325] and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances these activities  

[7:4:66,335] with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by acquiring  

[7:5:66,345] lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.  

[8:0:66,366] The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to  

[8:1:66,376] restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.   The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the  

[8:2:66,386] Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed  

[8:3:66,396] to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,  

[8:4:66,407] modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 

[9:0:66,427] Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program  

[9:1:66,437] to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:413,13] 2020-21 STATE BUDGET — RES   11 

[2:0:166,29] 3125   California Tahoe Conservancy - Continued 

[3:0:66,83] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,102] 2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY  

[4:0:66,120] The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-

[4:1:66,130] acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have  

[4:2:66,140] significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits  

[4:3:66,151] and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments.  

[4:4:66,161] Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the  

[4:5:66,171] Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities,  

[4:6:66,181] including six beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe.  

[5:0:66,199] The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to  

[5:1:66,209] more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a  

[5:2:66,219] wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also  

[5:3:66,230] increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire,  

[5:4:66,240] clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This  

[5:5:66,250] work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change.  

[6:0:66,268] The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site  

[6:1:66,278] improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating  

[6:2:66,288] public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake.  

[6:3:66,306] 2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS  

[7:0:66,326] This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing  

[7:1:66,336] facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide  

[7:2:66,347] variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds  

[7:3:66,357] such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.  

[8:0:66,374] In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting  

[8:1:66,385] urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive  

[8:2:66,395] Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town  

[8:3:66,405] center objectives.   Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other  

[8:4:66,415] environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

[8:0:66,480] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[9:0:66,499] The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 9 residential and 17 non-residential  

[9:1:66,509] facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training,  

[9:2:66,520] and educational opportunities to young men and women. The facilities also allow the CCC to assist federal, state and local  

[9:3:66,530] agencies, as well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources.  

[9:4:66,548] The CCC residential facilities house 80 to 100 corpsmembers each and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people  

[9:5:66,558] together from across the state, and increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential  

[9:6:66,568] centers range in size from 30 to 60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

[8:0:66,503] 2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION  

[9:0:66,520] This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,  

[9:1:66,531] tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and  

[9:2:66,541] the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,  

[9:3:66,551] state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about  

[9:4:66,561] land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.  

[9:5:66,579] 2425 - GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[10:0:66,597] This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as   much  

[10:1:66,607] as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and  

[10:2:66,617] environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of  

[10:3:66,627] hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for  

[10:4:66,637] program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries. 

[10:5:66,655] 2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION  

[11:0:66,673] This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program  

[11:1:66,683] provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local  

[11:2:66,693] governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts  

[11:3:66,703] for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development  

[11:4:66,714] rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops

[3:2:66,111] 2435 - MINE RECLAMATION  

[4:0:66,128] This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface  

[4:1:66,139] Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim  

[4:2:66,149] mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and  

[4:3:66,159] remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.  

[4:4:66,177] 2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD  

[5:0:66,194] The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of  

[5:1:66,205] mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine  

[5:2:66,215] Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans,  

[5:3:66,225] and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to  

[5:4:66,235] comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local  

[5:5:66,245] government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

[6:0:164,286] 3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  

[7:0:66,307] The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the  

[7:1:66,317] property and resources of California.  

[8:0:66,338] CAL FIRE provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue and disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership  

[8:1:66,348] in the protection of life, property, and natural resources.  

[9:0:66,368] CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety  

[9:1:66,379] programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency  

[9:2:66,389] response.  

[10:0:66,409] CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing  

[10:1:66,419] diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention  

[10:2:66,430] awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management.  

[11:0:66,450] CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to  

[11:1:66,460] enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland  

[11:2:66,470] areas of California.  

[12:0:66,491] Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support  

[12:1:66,501] this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[6:0:66,212] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[6:1:65,231] • CAL FIRE Relief Staffing and Additional Surge Capacity—$85.6 million General Fund ongoing for additional firefighting  

[6:2:76,241] resources to provide CAL FIRE with operational flexibility throughout the peak fire season and beyond as fire conditions  

[6:3:76,251] dictate. These resources will be leveraged to provide relief for frontline firefighting staff, which will directly benefit employee  

[6:4:76,262] health and wellness. Additionally, these resources will serve as an immediate resource pool to be deployed strategically,  

[6:5:76,272] based on fire risk, to build CAL FIRE’s surge capacity by staffing additional engines during the late fall, winter, and early  

[6:6:76,282] spring, and adding a fourth firefighter on a portion of engines.  

[6:7:65,298] • Innovation Procurement Sprint—$4.4 million General Fund ($7.6 million ongoing) to enable CAL FIRE to implement the new,  

[6:8:76,308] pioneering wildfire prediction and modeling technology that was procured through the Innovation Procurement Sprint process  

[6:9:76,319] initiated through Executive Order N-04-19. The recently-executed contract will enable CAL FIRE to access a wildfire  

[6:10:76,329] predictive software program that   will be used to inform fire pre-positioning and suppression tactical operations, with the intent  

[6:11:76,339] to more readily control and contain wildfires, and to protect people and assets at risk.

[8:0:215,483] 3560   State Lands Commission  

[9:0:66,504] The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its  

[9:1:66,514] care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access.  

[9:2:66,525] Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars   in  

[9:3:66,535] revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources.  

[10:0:66,552] Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands  

[10:1:66,563] Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign  

[10:2:66,573] public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal  

[10:3:66,583] government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands  

[10:4:66,593] legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage responsible development, environmental  

[10:5:66,603] preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law Public Trust  

[10:6:66,614] Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the trust.  

[11:0:66,631] Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and  

[11:1:66,642] lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high  

[11:2:66,652] water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands,  

[11:3:66,662] which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California.  

[11:4:66,672] School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the  

[11:5:66,682] five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state  

[11:6:66,693] ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest  

[11:7:66,703] in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

[8:0:66,431] 2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[9:0:66,448] The   Mineral Resources Management Division   oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands.  

[9:1:66,458] The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the  

[9:2:66,469] safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,  

[9:3:66,479] geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public  

[9:4:66,489] safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources  

[9:5:66,499] through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also promulgates regulations for the prevention of oil spills and  

[9:6:66,509] the safe operation of offshore facilities and   conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives fair value for  

[9:7:66,520] the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the oil and gas  

[9:8:66,530] facilities under its jurisdiction.  

[10:0:66,548] Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-

[11:2:66,624] Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from   Lake  

[11:3:66,634] Tahoe and   the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast   in the west, and include California’s  

[11:4:66,644] two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin.  

[12:0:66,662] Under the Land Management Program, the Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California  

[12:1:66,672] Legislature to approximately 70 local jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including  

[12:2:66,682] the state’s five major ports. The Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for  

[12:3:66,692] use or development, preserving and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands.

[8:0:183,330] 3790   Department of Parks and Recreation  

[9:0:66,351] The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and  

[9:1:66,361] education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most  

[9:2:66,372] valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and  

[9:3:66,382] future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the  

[9:4:66,392] major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural  

[9:5:66,402] resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park  

[9:6:66,412] visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and  

[9:7:66,423] water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,  

[9:8:66,433] jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,  

[9:9:66,443] plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing  

[9:10:66,453] financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.  

[10:0:66,474] Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need.  

[10:1:66,484] For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:196,218] 3860   Department of Water Resources  

[6:0:66,240] The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department  

[7:0:66,250] evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing  

[7:1:66,260] needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to  

[8:0:66,270] prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its  

[8:1:66,281] efficient use.  

[9:0:66,301] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[9:1:66,311] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[5:0:66,181] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,201] 3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN  

[7:0:66,218] The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water  

[7:1:66,229] resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to  

[7:2:66,239] consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water  

[7:3:66,249] conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water  

[7:4:66,259] supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan  

[7:5:66,269] identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,  

[7:6:66,280] recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,  

[7:7:66,290] groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected  

[7:8:66,300] catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare  

[7:9:66,310] integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure  

[7:10:66,320] sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,  

[7:11:66,331] protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water Element for their  

[7:12:66,341] General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local agencies and  

[7:13:66,351] tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination.  

[8:0:66,369] 3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM  

[9:0:66,386] The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21  

[9:1:66,397] pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,  

[9:2:66,407] pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.  

[10:0:66,425] The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water  

[10:1:66,435] to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.  

[11:0:66,452] The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,  

[11:1:66,463] timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental  

[11:2:66,473] commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and  

[11:3:66,483] federal regulations and permits.  

[12:0:66,501] 3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE  

[13:0:66,518] This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper  

[13:1:66,529] construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include  

[13:2:66,539] assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use  

[13:3:66,549] of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities,  

[13:4:66,559] coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in  

[13:5:66,569] cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way  

[13:6:66,580] for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and the  

[13:7:66,590] reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities  

[13:8:66,600] associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The  

[13:9:66,610] program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety.  

[14:0:66,628] 3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD  

[15:0:66,648] The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC),  

[15:1:66,659] designated floodways, and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by  

[15:2:66,669] issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that  

[15:3:66,679] protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San  

[15:4:66,689] Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large  

[15:5:66,699] joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies that operate  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[5:0:66,169] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[6:0:66,188] The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control  

[6:1:66,199] system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage  

[6:2:66,209] facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700  

[6:3:66,219] miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated  

[6:4:66,229] farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate  

[6:5:66,239] reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the  

[6:6:66,250] Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank  

[6:7:66,260] protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,  

[6:8:66,270] pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood  

[6:9:66,280] protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

[8:1:66,342] Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is  

[8:2:66,352] to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and  

[8:3:66,362] enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and  

[9:0:66,372] enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted  

[9:1:66,383] a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.  

[9:2:66,393] Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other  

[9:3:66,403] relevant agencies. In 2019, the Council completed its five-year review of the Delta Plan as required   under state law.   The  

[10:0:66,413] Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent Science Board. The mission  

[10:1:66,423] of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to inform water and environmental
