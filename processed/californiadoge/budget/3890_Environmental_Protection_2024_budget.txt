[1:0:211,39] 3900   State Air Resources Board  

[2:0:66,60] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes  

[3:0:66,70] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in  

[3:1:66,79] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.  

[4:0:66,89] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans  

[4:1:66,99] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources, fuels, consumer products, and industrial sources  

[5:0:66,109] established by the Board and local air districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility to develop measures to  

[5:1:66,118] reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006  

[5:2:66,128] (AB 32), Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 32), and Chapter 337, Statutes of 2022 (AB 1279). The Air Resources Board  

[5:3:66,138] oversees an extensive portfolio of incentives intended to reduce air pollution (including greenhouse gases), support shifts  

[5:4:66,148] towards less-polluting transportation options, and advance zero emission technologies, among other purposes. The Air  

[5:5:66,158] Resources Board is also responsible for developing guidance for agencies administering California Climate Investments  

[6:0:66,167] programs to ensure statutory requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are met, including maximizing benefits for  

[6:1:66,177] disadvantaged communities, reporting, and quantification methods, pursuant to Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014 (SB 862), and  

[6:2:66,187] serves as the account administrator for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.   The Air Resources Board also implements the  

[6:3:66,197] Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136,  

[6:4:66,206] Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with local air districts, the business community, scientists,  

[6:5:66,216] community representatives, and other stakeholders to implement its programs.  

[7:0:66,236] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay  

[7:1:66,245] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:1:66,87] 3540 - PESTICIDE PROGRAMS  

[4:0:66,107] Pesticide Programs protect California residents and the environment from adverse pesticide impacts with particular emphasis  

[4:1:66,117] on the protection of children, vulnerable populations, and communities. Specific activities include:  

[4:2:65,134] • Evaluating   whether to register pesticide products for sale or use in California.  

[4:3:65,150] • Assessing human health and environmental (air, water quality, and wildlife) risks from pesticides.  

[4:4:65,166] • Examining, licensing, and certifying individuals and businesses that recommend, perform, or supervise pest control.  

[4:5:65,181] • Collecting pesticide use data and evaluating use trends.  

[5:0:65,197] • Monitoring pesticide residues in fresh produce, air, and water as well as occupational settings.  

[5:1:65,213] • Protecting surface and groundwater from pesticide movement through evaluation, prevention, and mitigation.  

[5:2:65,229] • Protecting non-target wildlife from pesticide risks.  

[6:0:65,244] • Reevaluating and mitigating human health and environmental hazards from pesticides.  

[6:1:65,260] • Overseeing local enforcement of pesticide laws and regulations by County Agricultural Commissioners.  

[6:2:65,276] • Ensuring pesticide products sold in the marketplace are registered and meet state health, environmental, and safety  

[6:3:76,286] standards and that sellers comply with mill assessment responsibilities.

[1:0:421,13] ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

[2:0:136,32] 3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund  

[3:1:66,78] program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,290 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups,  

[3:2:66,88] and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 249 sites where the cleanup process is complete.  

[3:3:66,98] Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,061 land-use restrictions in  

[3:4:66,108] place on properties throughout the state.  

[4:0:66,125] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other  

[4:1:66,135] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to  

[4:2:66,144] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties,  

[4:3:66,154] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military  

[4:4:66,164] installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former  

[4:5:66,174] hazardous waste disposal site.  

[5:0:66,191] The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness  

[5:1:66,201] for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills  

[5:2:66,211] and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.  

[6:0:66,228] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,245] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of  

[7:1:66,255] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at  

[7:2:66,265] 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 800 registered businesses that transport hazardous  

[7:3:66,274] waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300  

[7:4:66,284] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[7:5:66,294] assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of  

[7:6:66,304] the Unified Program.  

[8:0:66,321] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[8:1:66,331] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste  

[8:2:66,341] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused  

[8:3:66,350] enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste  

[8:4:66,360] and used oil.  

[9:0:66,377] 3626 - HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES  

[10:0:66,395] The Hazardous Waste Facilities program oversees the hazardous waste permitted facilities that are permitting for storage,  

[10:1:66,404] treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees the  

[10:2:66,414] maintenance activities and compliance at 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste and approximately 300  

[10:3:66,424] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[10:4:66,434] assurance resources.  

[11:0:66,451] The program monitors permitted hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[11:1:66,461] electronic manifest surveillance, enforcement of hazardous waste requirement violations found through routine inspections;  

[11:2:66,471] complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused enforcement initiatives.  

[12:0:66,488] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS  

[13:0:66,505] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic  

[13:1:66,515] chemicals that are used in consumer products. The SCP program calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by  

[13:2:66,525] identifying safer alternatives that eliminate or reduce the use of hazardous chemicals which may harm people or the  

[13:3:66,534] environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order to identify Priority  

[13:4:66,544] Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the analysis of safer  

[13:5:66,554] alternatives, and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption of "green  

[13:6:66,564] chemistry" practices.  

[14:0:66,581] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY  

[15:0:66,598] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)  

[15:1:66,608] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified  

[15:2:66,618] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for  

[15:3:66,628] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response  

[15:4:66,637] plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements  

[15:5:66,647] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.  

[16:0:66,664] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,682] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities  

[17:1:66,692] surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as closure and corrective action at the facility  

[17:2:66,701] itself. Under the program, the department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including  

[18:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[8:0:66,352] The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians   and the state's  

[9:0:66,361] environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support, and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office  

[9:1:66,371] performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as  

[9:2:66,381] other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with scientific tools and information upon which to base risk-

[10:0:66,391] management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing hazards and   health risks, including risks to children and other  

[10:1:66,400] sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, and fish and  

[10:2:66,410] shellfish, as well as health and environmental impacts from climate change. The Office also evaluates community pollution  

[10:3:66,420] burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities and reduce exposures and  

[10:4:66,430] risks to residents.
