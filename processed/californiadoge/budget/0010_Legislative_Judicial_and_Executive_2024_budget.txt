[11:0:66,463] The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and  

[11:1:66,473] establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal  

[11:2:66,483] and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  

[11:3:66,500] Because the Legislature's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to  

[11:4:66,510] support this need.   For the specifics on the Legislature's   capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[16:0:66,628] The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was  

[16:1:66,638] completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for  

[16:2:66,648] construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.   The Annex, which was  

[16:3:66,658] completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices.  

[16:4:66,675] Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored,  

[16:5:66,685] rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

[9:0:139,366] 0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System  

[10:0:66,387] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional  

[10:1:66,397] officers, and legislative statutory officers.  

[11:0:66,416] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of  

[11:1:66,426] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,  

[11:2:66,436] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.   The Legislators'  

[11:3:66,445] Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 

[12:0:66,465] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November  

[12:1:66,475] 6, 1990.   Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340)  

[12:2:66,485] closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory  

[12:3:66,494] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[6:0:208,199] 0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau  

[7:0:66,220] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal services to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members and  

[7:1:66,230] committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The legal  

[7:2:66,239] services furnished include rendering legal opinions, drafting bills and other legislative measures, counseling, attending  

[7:3:66,249] meetings of legislative committees as counsel, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The Bureau also provides legal  

[7:4:66,259] services to the Governor and advises state agencies as to the preparation of legislative measures. An attorney-client  

[7:5:66,269] relationship is maintained and all work is confidential.  

[8:0:66,288] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative  

[8:1:66,298] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes.  

[9:0:66,318] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides technology services to the Legislature, including IT services  

[9:1:66,327] in support of legislative business operations and the legislative information system, which provides information to the public

[9:0:242,409] 0250   Judicial Branch  

[10:0:66,430] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of  

[10:1:66,440] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.  

[10:2:66,450] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially  

[10:3:66,460] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.  

[11:0:66,479] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent  

[11:1:66,489] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was  

[11:2:66,499] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This  

[12:0:66,508] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The  

[12:1:66,518] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty  

[12:2:66,528] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments  

[12:3:66,538] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted  

[12:4:66,548] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act  

[12:5:66,557] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the  

[12:6:66,567] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial  

[12:7:66,577] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are  

[12:8:66,587] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of  

[12:9:66,596] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities  

[12:10:66,606] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.  

[13:0:66,626] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,  

[13:1:66,636] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United  

[13:2:66,645] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.  

[14:0:66,665] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay  

[14:1:66,675] program to support this need. For   the specifics on   the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[27:1:51,666] Balance Constraints for 2022-23. Non-state funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[28:0:51,672] 2/  Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees. 

[28:1:51,680] 3/  Reflects the preliminary budgets of 57 trial courts based on courts' 2023-24 Schedule 1 submissions. 

[29:0:51,687] 4/  Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.  

[30:0:51,695] 5/  See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-

[30:1:51,701] court entities, and as a result are not included in the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1. 

[31:0:51,708] 6/  See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding"  

[32:0:51,714] revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, 
[33:0:51,719] 7/  For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due  

[33:1:51,726] to timing and accounting differences. For the current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[34:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details. 

[35:0:51,738] 8/  Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2022-23 and estimated expenditures for 2023-24 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2023-24 Enacted Budget.

[14:0:33,244] 1/  Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, and GF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state operations  

[14:1:33,252] component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). Expenditures are rounded to the nearest thousand. 

[15:0:33,271] 2/  These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding,  

[15:1:33,279] Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts"  

[15:2:33,286] amount in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1).  

[16:0:33,304] 3/  This reflects judges' compensation paid, excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" (Figure 1)  

[16:1:33,312] revenue amounts reported ($153.392 million in 2022-23 and $177.838 million in 2023-24). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed  

[16:2:33,319] by the TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2022-23 and 2023-24 participated in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF. 

[17:0:33,338] 4/  Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training  

[17:1:33,346] (DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects the appropriated  

[17:2:33,353] funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program (FFDRP). 

[18:0:33,370] 5/  For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred  

[18:1:33,378] to the JBWCF.

[1:0:414,13] 2024-25 STATE BUDGET — LJE   21 

[2:0:207,32] 0250   Judicial Branch - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 0130 - SUPREME COURT  

[4:0:66,103] The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state  

[4:1:66,113] courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the  

[4:2:66,123] Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations  

[4:3:66,133] for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of  

[4:4:66,142] statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the  

[4:5:66,152] Supreme Court.  

[4:6:66,169] 0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL  

[5:0:66,189] Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six  

[5:1:66,199] District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the  

[5:2:66,209] Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law.  

[5:3:66,226] 0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL  

[6:0:66,245] The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21  

[6:1:66,255] voting members and 9 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as the  

[6:2:66,265] administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation of  

[6:3:66,275] the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and  

[6:4:66,284] administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges,  

[6:5:66,294] technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research.  

[6:6:66,312] 0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,331] The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of  

[7:1:66,341] judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real  

[7:2:66,351] estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction.  

[7:3:66,368] 0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING  

[8:0:66,385] California has 58 trial courts, one in each county. In trial courts, or superior courts, a judge and sometimes a jury hears  

[8:1:66,395] witnesses' testimony and other evidence and decides cases by applying the relevant law to the facts.   Trial courts have trial  

[8:2:66,405] jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases. To accomplish various statutory mandates, the State Trial Court Funding Program  

[8:3:66,414] supports trial courts through the following programs:  

[8:4:66,434] 0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS  

[9:0:66,451] This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and  

[9:1:66,461] criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003.  

[9:2:66,478] 0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL  

[10:0:66,496] This program provides funding for court-appointed counsel for children, non-minor dependents and parents in juvenile court  

[10:1:66,505] dependency proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 317, subdivisions (b) and (c), and Government  

[10:2:66,515] Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4).  

[10:3:66,532] 0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES  

[10:4:66,550] This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges.  

[10:5:66,567] 0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES  

[11:0:66,584] This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the

[5:0:180,218] 0280   Commission on Judicial Performance  

[6:0:66,239] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of  

[6:1:66,249] judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California  

[6:2:66,259] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of  

[6:3:66,268] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or  

[6:4:66,278] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.  

[6:5:66,288] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.  

[7:0:66,307] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial  

[7:1:66,317] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation  

[7:2:66,327] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal  

[7:3:66,337] from office.  

[8:0:66,356] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the  

[8:1:66,366] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,  

[8:2:66,376] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.  

[8:3:66,386] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[9:0:150,349] 0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System  

[10:0:66,370] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and  

[10:1:66,379] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement  

[10:2:66,389] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.  

[11:0:66,407] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in  

[11:1:66,416] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System  

[11:2:66,426] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final  

[11:3:66,436] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement  

[11:4:66,446] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of  

[11:5:66,455] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined  

[11:6:66,465] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II is funded  

[11:7:66,475] through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. The state's contributions are adjusted  

[11:8:66,485] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.  

[12:0:66,504] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,  

[12:1:66,514] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges  

[12:2:66,524] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing  

[12:3:66,534] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit  

[12:4:66,543] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the  

[12:5:66,553] required benefit payments to retired judges.  

[13:0:66,573] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of  

[13:1:66,582] 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[8:1:66,281] state, promotes more youth and community engagement, and advances public awareness and outreach campaigns to tackle  

[8:2:66,291] the state’s most pressing challenges.  

[9:0:66,308] GO SERVE consists of the California Volunteers, the Office of Community Partnerships and Strategic Communications, and the  

[9:1:66,318] Youth Empowerment Commission.   California Volunteers aims to increase the number and impact of Californians involved with  

[9:2:66,328] service and volunteering throughout the state. The Office of Community Partnerships and Strategic Communications

[9:4:66,347] communities. The Youth Empowerment Commission provides meaningful opportunities for civic engagement to improve the  

[9:5:66,357] quality of life for California’s disconnected and disadvantaged youth.  

[10:0:66,374] Chapter 41, Statutes of 2024 (SB 164) established GO SERVE on July 1, 2024, and transferred California Volunteers, the

[8:0:66,369] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:0:66,388] 0372 -  California Volunteers  

[10:0:66,405] California Volunteers is tasked with engaging Californians in service, volunteering and civic action to tackle the state’s most  

[10:1:66,415] pressing challenges while lifting up all communities. The California Service Corps consists of the CaliforniansForAll College  

[10:2:66,425] Corps, Youth Service Corps, California Climate Action Corps, and AmeriCorps California. From the California Climate Action  

[10:3:66,434] Corps, the country’s first statewide climate corps program, to the CaliforniansForAll service initiative launched in response to  

[10:4:66,444] COVID-19 to establish a volunteer corps to support the state’s response to emergencies and disasters, California Volunteers  

[10:5:66,454] plays an integral role in addressing the state’s problems. California Volunteers is supported by a bipartisan 25-member  

[10:6:66,464] Commission and a team of experts driven by a mission to empower and mobilize all Californians to volunteer and serve in their  

[10:7:66,473] communities.  

[11:0:66,491] California Volunteers also houses the Youth Empowerment Commission that engages youth directly with policymakers  

[11:1:66,501] providing meaningful opportunities for civic engagement to improve the quality of life for California’s underserved and  

[11:2:66,510] marginalized youth. The Commission examines and discusses policy and fiscal issues affecting the interests, needs, and  

[11:3:66,520] conditions of the youth of California, formally advises and makes recommendations to the Legislature, Superintendent of Public  

[11:4:66,530] Instruction, and Governor on specific legislative and fiscal issues affecting youth.  

[12:0:66,547] 0373 -  Office of Community Partnerships and Strategic Communications  

[13:0:66,564] The Office of   Community Partnerships   and Strategic Communications is a   single state entity coordinating California’s most  

[13:1:66,574] important statewide public awareness and community outreach efforts, which   allows the state to realize more inclusive and  

[13:2:66,584] effective outcomes while preventing equity gaps in statewide outreach. With the unprecedented scale of the challenges  

[13:3:66,594] California is facing, the state must be able to communicate effectively with all Californians, including those who are  

[13:4:66,603] experiencing the greatest health and social inequities. The tested model of an ecosystem of trusted messengers builds on the  

[13:5:66,613] success of Census 2020 and Vaccinate ALL 58 campaigns. The Office implements micro-targeted public education and  

[13:6:66,623] communication efforts to benefit under-served Californians. The Office’s tested model of State-CBO outreach collaboration  

[13:7:66,633] employs a result-based management system to: 1) implement data-driven and qualitative analysis for accountability,  

[13:8:66,643] evaluation, and resource allocations; 2) analyze data trends to identify communities of concern and monitor outputs; 3)   fund  

[13:9:66,652] community-based organizations to address access and inclusion through relevant cultural and in-language materials and  

[13:10:66,662] tactics; 4) execute integrated media campaigns to reach targeted populations and collaborating with media, including ethnic  

[13:11:66,672] media, to dispel misinformation; 5) coordinate with state and public agencies, elected representatives, faith-based  

[13:12:66,682] organizations, philanthropy, and other civil society groups to leverage resources and expand impact.

[13:0:202,604] 0690   Office of Emergency Services  

[14:0:66,625] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency  

[14:1:66,635] response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's  

[14:2:66,645] Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's  

[14:3:66,654] homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for,  

[14:4:66,664] protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats.  

[14:5:66,681] Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal  

[14:6:66,691] agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in  

[14:7:66,701] emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own  

[15:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,68] resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the  

[3:1:66,78] federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.  

[4:0:66,96] During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's  

[4:1:66,105] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal  

[4:2:66,115] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the  

[4:3:66,125] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes  

[4:4:66,135] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  

[5:0:66,152] Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and  

[5:1:66,162] the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS  

[5:2:66,171] assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of   and response to criminal and terrorist activity and   also facilitates  

[5:3:66,181] information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners.  

[6:0:66,198] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety   Commission   is a separate unit within the   Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to  

[6:1:66,208] lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well  

[6:2:66,218] as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management.  

[7:0:66,235] Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this  

[7:1:66,245] need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES  

[5:0:66,103] Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program  

[5:1:66,113] coordinates the provision   of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended  

[5:2:66,123] in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-

[5:3:66,133] hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National  

[5:4:66,142] Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this  

[5:5:66,152] program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to  

[5:6:66,162] all hazards.  

[6:0:66,179] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,196] Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services  

[7:1:66,206] grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland  

[7:2:66,216] Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency  

[7:3:66,226] management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant  

[7:4:66,236] management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with  

[7:5:66,245] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the  

[7:6:66,255] centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion  

[7:7:66,265] center.  

[8:0:66,282] 0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION  

[9:0:66,299] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent  

[9:1:66,309] earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s  

[9:2:66,319] progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.   The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate,  

[9:3:66,329] and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.   The  

[9:4:66,339] Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support  

[9:5:66,348] the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.   These activities include: (1) developing and  

[9:6:66,358] reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related  

[9:7:66,368] legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies,  

[9:8:66,378] where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and  

[9:9:66,387] supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery.  

[9:10:66,405] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS  

[10:0:66,424] The Public Safety Communications   program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the  

[10:1:66,434] state's   public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The   program is dedicated to the  

[10:2:66,444] preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that  

[10:3:66,454] keep the public connected during times of crisis.  

[10:4:66,471] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE  

[11:0:66,490] The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of   Cal OES and support services such as

[9:0:66,453] The Bureau of Firearms (BOF) implements and enforces California's firearms and ammunition   laws by administering a  

[9:1:66,462] multitude of different state-mandated firearms and ammunition-related programs. This is accomplished by conducting firearm  

[9:2:66,472] and ammunition eligibility checks, conducting compliance inspections of firearm dealers, ammunition vendors, and  

[9:3:66,482] manufacturers, and by providing valuable training to stakeholders statewide. BOF Special Agents conduct investigations into  

[9:4:66,492] armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of firearms, magazines, and ammunition. Finally,  

[9:5:66,501] BOF Special Agents conduct investigations to monitor and   prevent illegal   firearms trafficking at permitted gun shows in  

[9:6:66,511] accordance with state and federal laws.

[11:0:66,619] The Bureau of Gambling Control (BGC) regulates California cardrooms and tribal casinos to ensure gambling is conducted  

[11:1:66,629] honestly and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of

[11:3:66,648] with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. BGC also encompasses an audit component to ensure solvency in  

[11:4:66,658] gambling establishments and provides investigative audit expertise. BGC conducts criminal investigations in and around tribal

[10:0:66,471] California's elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the second largest insurance market in the world with insurance  

[10:1:66,481] companies collecting more than $413 billion in premiums annually in California while protecting consumers and ensuring the  

[10:2:66,491] health and sustainability of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is “Insurance  

[10:3:66,501] Protection for All Californians.” CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their  

[10:4:66,510] dealings with insurance companies, and enhancing business processes to better address emerging and future challenges as  

[10:5:66,520] well as improving services for insurance producers, consumers, and businesses.

[11:1:66,547] 1,400 insurance companies and more than 495,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents, brokers, adjusters,  

[11:2:66,557] and bail agents and annually issues approximately 288,000 licenses (new and renewals). Additionally, CDI receives and  

[11:3:66,567] investigates approximately 295,000 consumer inquiries and complaints annually, performs hundreds of ongoing risk-focused  

[11:4:66,576] financial surveillances and market conduct examinations of insurance companies, receives more than 20,000 suspected  

[11:5:66,586] fraudulent claim referrals and investigates approximately 1,300 of those referrals, receives and reviews approximately 5,700  

[11:6:66,596] rate filing applications annually, and works in conjunction with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate  

[11:7:66,606] and prosecute fraudulent insurance practices.

[2:0:181,32] 0845   Department of Insurance - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to make sure they can provide  

[3:1:66,78] the benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and  

[3:2:66,88] underlying assumptions to ensure transparency and consistency in models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by  

[3:3:66,98] insurance companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty  

[3:4:66,108] insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the California Insurance Code  

[3:5:66,117] and the California Code of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance  

[3:6:66,127] sector; (6) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance  

[3:7:66,137] companies to get unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases  

[3:8:66,147] are actuarially justified and not excessive; (8) perform market conduct reviews to ensure compliance; and (9) ensure that  

[3:9:66,156] applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure.  

[3:10:66,166] Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies through the Conservation and  

[3:11:66,176] Liquidation Office.  

[3:12:66,193] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION  

[4:0:66,211] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders  

[4:1:66,220] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or  

[4:2:66,230] underwriting by insurers and producers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent  

[4:3:66,240] practices and from incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved  

[4:4:66,250] and historically disadvantaged communities; and (4) assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community  

[4:5:66,259] service organizations, and neighborhood associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed  

[4:6:66,269] informational guides, workshops, seminars, roundtables, and town halls.  

[4:7:66,286] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL  

[5:0:66,304] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for  

[5:1:66,314] prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace  

[5:2:66,323] officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the  

[5:3:66,333] Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition,  

[5:4:66,343] the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower “qui tam” actions seeking civil penalties against  

[5:5:66,353] perpetrators of insurance fraud.  

[6:0:66,370] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE  

[7:0:66,387] This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws  

[7:1:66,397] contained in the Insurance Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and  

[7:2:66,407] Fee Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the  

[7:3:66,416] premium tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

[8:0:183,343] 0850   California State Lottery Commission  

[9:0:66,364] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an  

[9:1:66,374] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it  

[9:2:66,383] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to  

[9:3:66,393] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by  

[9:4:66,403] the State Senate.  

[10:0:66,420] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34  

[10:1:66,430] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be  

[10:2:66,440] used for administrative costs.  

[11:0:66,457] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost  

[11:1:66,467] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of  

[11:2:66,476] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery  

[11:3:66,486] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily  

[11:4:66,496] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the  

[11:5:66,506] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.  

[12:0:66,523] In the 38 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2023, the California State Lottery has raised $43.8 billion  

[12:1:66,533] for public education, including approximately $2.3 billion in 2022-23.  

[13:0:66,550] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2023-24 and 2024-25 cannot be made  

[13:1:66,560] with certainty.

[1:0:169,65] 0855   California Gambling Control Commission  

[2:0:66,86] The mission of the California Gambling Control Commission (Commission) is to protect the public by ensuring integrity and  

[2:1:66,96] justice in California's controlled gambling industry through effective regulations and fair application of the law. The Commission  

[2:2:66,106] has jurisdiction over gambling establishments (cardrooms), third-party providers of proposition player services, and certain  

[2:3:66,115] aspects of Tribal casinos, pursuant to its authority under state law and Tribal-State Gaming Compacts (Compacts). The  

[2:4:66,125] Commission also has jurisdiction over gaming policies, regulations, criteria, and standards.

[5:0:66,151] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,170] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES  

[7:0:66,190] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption.  

[7:1:66,199] During the 2022-23 fiscal year, this Division handled 11,347 security investment transactions totaling $546.5 billion. The Pooled  

[7:2:66,209] Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 10,197 of these transactions totaling $507.5 billion; time deposits  

[7:3:66,219] accounted for 848 transactions totaling $27.6 billion. The remaining $11 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special funds,  

[7:4:66,229] such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's  

[7:5:66,238] retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment  

[7:6:66,248] program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the  

[7:7:66,258] 2022-23 fiscal year, 2,361 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $28.7 billion for the fiscal year.  

[8:0:66,275] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT  

[9:0:66,295] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System  

[9:1:66,305] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires  

[9:2:66,314] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,  

[9:3:66,324] giving the PMIB the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,  

[9:4:66,334] and loans to the General Fund.  

[10:0:66,354] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of  

[10:1:66,363] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that  

[10:2:66,373] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer  

[10:3:66,383] maintains demand bank accounts with seven banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for  

[10:4:66,393] the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies.  

[11:0:66,412] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts  

[11:1:66,422] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer  

[11:2:66,432] of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks, 5) redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for  

[11:3:66,441] payment, 6) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities  

[11:4:66,451] pledged to the state, 7) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state as collateral for the time, demand,  

[11:5:66,461] and other state agency programs, and 8) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by  

[11:6:66,471] or pledged to the state.  

[12:0:66,488] 0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE  

[13:0:66,508] The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes,  

[13:1:66,517] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The  

[13:2:66,527] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to  

[13:3:66,537] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.  

[14:0:66,556] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse  

[14:1:66,566] consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance   includes monitoring  

[14:2:66,576] the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and  

[14:3:66,586] ensuring proper record keeping.  

[15:0:66,603] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES  

[16:0:66,620] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support  

[16:1:66,630] services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems,  

[16:2:66,640] business services, technical support, and production operations.

[1:0:165,69] 0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee  

[2:0:66,90] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State  

[2:1:66,100] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,  

[2:2:66,109] such as the creation of affordable housing.  

[3:0:66,127] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual  

[3:1:66,136] basis. The bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by multiplying the state population by $120 in 2023; a factor determined  

[3:2:66,146] by the IRS each year. California's limit totaled almost $4.7 billion in 2023.  

[4:0:66,163] The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers  

[4:1:66,173] authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state  

[4:2:66,183] or federal government.  

[5:0:66,200] The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of six members, including three voting members and three  

[5:1:66,210] advisors. The voting members are the State Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor, and the State Controller  

[5:2:66,220] or their designee. The non-voting (advisory) members are the Director of Housing and Community Development, the Executive  

[5:3:66,230] Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and a representative from local government selected by two voting  

[5:4:66,239] members.

[2:0:130,32] 0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost to develop multifamily rental  

[3:1:66,78] housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers produce  

[3:2:66,88] affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and families. To  

[3:3:66,98] qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or reserve at  

[3:4:66,108] least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for  

[3:5:66,117] four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint  

[3:6:66,127] Application.  

[4:0:66,144] Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance any of the following facilities identified by the IRS  

[4:1:66,154] as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities,  

[4:2:66,164] high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the  

[4:3:66,174] project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to  

[4:4:66,183] protect and enhance the environment.  

[5:0:66,201] Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to assist first-time  

[5:1:66,211] homebuyers with purchasing homes. Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached,  

[5:2:66,220] condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the  

[5:3:66,230] program's purchase price limitations.  

[6:0:66,247] Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds  

[6:1:66,257] issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and  

[6:2:66,267] midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their  

[6:3:66,277] communities.

[13:0:66,672] The Federal Program  

[14:0:66,689] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax  

[14:1:66,699] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise

[2:0:131,32] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and  

[3:1:66,78] indexed for inflation.  

[4:0:66,96] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the  

[4:1:66,105] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability  

[4:2:66,115] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of  

[4:3:66,125] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project  

[4:4:66,135] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each  

[4:5:66,144] year for a ten-year period.  

[5:0:66,162] The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation. For 2023, each  

[5:1:66,171] state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.75 per state resident. Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share  

[5:2:66,181] of unused credits in a national pool.  

[6:0:66,198] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects  

[6:1:66,208] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there  

[6:2:66,218] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments.  

[6:3:66,235] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires  

[6:4:66,245] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.  

[6:5:66,262] The State LIHTC Program  

[7:0:66,280] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the  

[7:1:66,289] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for  

[7:2:66,299] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax  

[7:3:66,309] credit status.  

[8:0:66,326] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2023, was $118.6 million. Investors take the state tax credit  

[8:1:66,336] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.  

[8:2:66,353] Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit  

[8:3:66,363] Allocation Committee to issue an additional $500 million in state low-income housing tax credits in 2020 to be paired with 4%  

[8:4:66,373] federal low-income housing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds to bolster new construction of low-income housing. Per AB 101,  

[8:5:66,383] this $500 million tax credit was issued for calendar years beginning in 2020, and for calendar years beginning in 2021 pursuant  

[8:6:66,392] to an authorization in the annual Budget Act or related legislation.  

[8:7:66,410] Farmworker Housing Program  

[9:0:66,427] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state  

[9:1:66,437] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,  

[9:2:66,446] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and  

[9:3:66,456] projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.  

[9:4:66,474] Beginning in 2024 through 2034 calendar year, AB 1654 allocates the lesser of 5% or $25,000,000 of the $500,000,000 state  

[9:5:66,483] low-income housing tax credits to be set aside for farmworker housing.  

[9:6:66,501] State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits  

[10:0:66,518] SB 451 authorized $50,000,000 in historic tax credits per calendar year, for a five-year period, beginning in 2021. These tax  

[10:1:66,528] credits are allocated by California Tax Credit Allocation Committee in conjunction with and upon approval from the Office of  

[10:2:66,537] Historic Preservation.

[8:0:66,355] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes  

[8:1:66,365] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently  

[8:2:66,375] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the  

[8:3:66,384] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  

[8:4:66,394] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,  

[8:5:66,404] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and  

[8:6:66,414] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit  

[9:0:66,423] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities  

[9:1:66,433] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.  

[10:0:66,453] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director  

[10:1:66,463] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,

[8:0:66,286] 0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY  

[9:0:66,305] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the  

[9:1:66,315] Authority,   loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and  

[9:2:66,325] approved by resolution of the Authority.  

[10:0:66,342] The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and  

[10:1:66,352] private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects  

[10:2:66,362] in California.  

[11:0:66,381] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative  

[11:1:66,391] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program   expanded   (Chapter 677, Statutes of  

[11:2:66,401] 2012)   to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes  

[11:3:66,410] of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment  

[11:4:66,420] that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product.   In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended  

[11:5:66,430] the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria  

[11:6:66,440] by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. In 2022, Chapter 251, Statutes of 2022, authorized CAEATFA an additional  

[11:7:66,450] $15 million per calendar year in STE for specific lithium projects for years 2022 to 2024. The objective of this program is to  

[11:8:66,459] promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases,  

[11:9:66,469] air and water pollution, and energy consumption.  

[12:0:66,489] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013  

[12:1:66,498] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority  

[12:2:66,508] developed a loan loss reserve program   for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and   a risk  

[12:3:66,518] mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs in California. A program to support low-

[12:4:66,528] interest financing of PACE efficiency projects in commercial buildings is in discussion.  

[13:0:66,547] The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in  

[13:1:66,557] collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission   to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot programs   to  

[13:2:66,567] encourage and leverage private capital lending   (in both the residential and commercial sectors). These programs   employ  

[13:3:66,577] various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making   energy efficiency  

[13:4:66,586] improvements   to help achieve the state's   energy efficiency and decarbonization   goals.   As current funding sources limit  

[13:5:66,596] eligibility to customers of the four Investor Owned Utilities, additional funding sources to expand statewide access to energy  

[13:6:66,606] efficiency improvements are under consideration.

[7:0:66,220] California Pollution Control Financing Authority (CPCFA) is committed to stimulating local economies in California by making  

[7:1:66,230] capital more accessible to small businesses and delivering innovative financing for projects that protect and restore the  

[7:2:66,240] environment.  

[8:0:66,257] Created in 1972, CPCFA originated as a conduit issuer of tax-exempt, pollution-control bonds and now assists the solid-waste,  

[8:1:66,267] recycling, water, and wastewater industries through its Private Activity Tax-Exempt Bond Program. Over the last 50 years,  

[8:2:66,277] CPCFA evolved to include financing programs assisting California's small business sector through its California Capital Access  

[8:3:66,287] Program (CalCAP), the California Investment and Innovation Program (Cal IIP), and to promote the reuse and redevelopment  

[8:4:66,296] of brownfields through the California Recycle Underutilized Sites Program (CALReUSE).  

[9:0:66,316] CPCFA consists of the following members: State Treasurer (Chairperson), the State Controller, and the Director of the

[5:0:66,189] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,208] 0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,225] CPCFA’s Tax-Exempt Bond Program provides access to the tax-exempt bond market for private companies serving a public  

[7:1:66,235] purpose, through the use of private activity bonds. California businesses may use private activity bonds for the acquisition,  

[7:2:66,245] construction, or installation of qualified waste disposal, waste recovery, water furnishing, and wastewater treatment, or the  

[7:3:66,254] acquisition and installation of new equipment. In addition, CPCFA maintains a Small Business Assistance Fund (SBAF) that  

[7:4:66,264] provides cost of issuance financial assistance to qualified small business borrowers.  

[8:0:66,281] Tax-exempt financing issued by CPCFA assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California  

[8:1:66,291] Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly  

[8:2:66,301] Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). From 1974  

[8:3:66,311] through June 30, 2023, CPCFA issued bonds totaling approximately $17.1 billion.  

[9:0:66,328] 0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  

[10:0:66,345] CalCAP for Small Business administers a loan loss reserve program that incentivizes participating financial institutions to make  

[10:1:66,355] loans to small businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund specific to each participating  

[10:2:66,365] financial institution. CPCFA, the financial institution, and the borrower all contribute to fund the reserve. CPCFA provides  

[10:3:66,375] additional incentives for lending to businesses located in underserved communities and disaster areas. The reserve serves to  

[10:4:66,384] reduce loan-loss risk to the participating financial institutions and facilitates and fosters the relationship between the small  

[10:5:66,394] business and participating lenders.  

[11:0:66,411] Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA’s Small Business Assistance Fund  

[11:1:66,421] (SBAF), established with fees collected from large companies issuing debt through CPCFA's tax-exempt bond program. In  

[11:2:66,431] October 2010 CalCAP received $6 million from the state's General Fund (Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010) to increase lending  

[11:3:66,441] efforts. The $6 million appropriation was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to  

[11:4:66,450] become the primary source for the State's contributions.  

[12:0:66,468] In 2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from the U.S. Treasury's State  

[12:1:66,478] Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI 1.0). CPCFA shared the allocation with the Infrastructure and Economic Development  

[12:2:66,487] Bank (IBank), now housed within the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz).  

[13:0:66,505] These funds enabled CPCFA to expand the availability of its CalCAP for Small Business (CalCAP SB). In addition, CPCFA  

[13:1:66,514] launched the Collateral Support Program (CSP) to further offset financial institution’s resistance to lend after the 2008  

[13:2:66,524] recession. CPCFA created the CSP with a recapture provision allowing for the sustainability of the program.  

[14:0:66,541] The federal government ended the SSBCI 1.0 program in 2017. At the request of the U.S. Treasury, CalCAP SB instituted an  

[14:1:66,551] annual recapture provision to provide sustainability beyond the active federal funding.  

[15:0:66,568] In 2021, the federal government reauthorized the funding of SSBCI (SSBCI 2.0). CPCFA and IBank partnered again to apply  

[15:1:66,578] for SSBCI 2.0 allocation and equally share the $1.181 billion allocated to California. Funding will be received in three tranches.  

[15:2:66,588] Recapture for the CalCAP SB program has been suspended for the SSBCI 2.0 program.  

[16:0:66,605] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,623] The California Recycle Underutilized Sites (CALReUSE) program assisted with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized  

[17:1:66,632] properties with real or perceived contamination issues. CALReUSE addressed a funding and information gap in the  

[17:2:66,642] development of contaminated properties (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000,  

[17:3:66,652] the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per  

[17:4:66,662] brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the  

[17:5:66,671] development of remedial action plans. Eligible projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped  

[17:6:66,681] due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time  

[17:7:66,691] frames and the regulatory process.

[2:0:116,32] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund  

[3:1:66,78] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received  

[3:2:66,88] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds and   provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project for brownfield remediation that  

[3:3:66,98] promoted affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. Three projects were pre-approved to receive awards of  

[3:4:66,108] more than $5 million; one grant was increased above $5 million when returned funds became available. All CALReUSE  

[3:5:66,117] Program funds have been awarded and CPCFA continues to monitor and administer open grants to ensure compliance and  

[3:6:66,127] completion. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites in 30 California communities  

[3:7:66,137] has leveraged the completion of 2,310 housing units to date, of which 80% are affordable.  

[4:0:66,154] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS  

[5:0:66,174] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative  

[5:1:66,183] energy production, CPCFA is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's  

[5:2:66,193] environmental goals. CPCFA is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources ("Independent Contributors")  

[5:3:66,203] including federal and state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.  

[6:0:66,220] Using the Independent Contributor program and the CalCAP loan loss reserve model, the CPCFA partnered with the California  

[6:1:66,230] Air Resources Board (CARB) to assist truck and bus owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of  

[6:2:66,240] $215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds to incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that comply with CARB's  

[6:3:66,250] Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The CalCAP-CARB Heavy-Duty Vehicle Air Quality Loan Program ended on July 31, 2023.  

[6:4:66,259] CPCFA continues to partner with CARB to implement a zero-emissions loan loss reserve program.  

[7:0:66,277] CPCFA also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit  

[7:1:66,286] enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to install electric vehicle charging stations.

[3:0:66,68] • No Place Like Home Program  

[4:0:66,86] Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program, which requires the Department  

[4:1:66,96] of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to award up to $2 billion to counties for the acquisition, design, construction,  

[4:2:66,105] rehabilitation, or preservation of permanent supportive housing for individuals living with a severe mental illness who are  

[4:3:66,115] homeless or at risk of chronic homelessness. Chapter 322, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1628) authorized CHFFA to enter into  

[4:4:66,125] contracts with HCD and further authorized CHFFA to issue up to $2 billion in taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the NPLH  

[4:5:66,135] Program. Chapter 41, Statutes of 2018 (AB 1827) placed the NPLH Program on the November 2018 ballot (Proposition 2),  

[4:6:66,144] where it was adopted by the voters as the No Place Like Home Act. This ratified existing law establishing the NPLH Program  

[4:7:66,154] as being consistent with the Mental Health Services Act approved through Proposition 63 in 2004. It also ratified the issuance  

[4:8:66,164] of up to $2 billion in previously authorized bonds.

[6:0:66,248] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:1:66,267] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD  

[7:0:66,286] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, which allows  

[7:1:66,296] individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Chapter 774, Statutes of  

[7:2:66,306] 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board to administer the California ABLE Program.  

[8:0:66,326] The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the  

[8:1:66,335] purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse  

[8:2:66,345] needs of ABLE customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in  

[8:3:66,355] providing financial services.  

[9:0:66,372] Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $18,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's  

[9:1:66,382] ABLE account. Funds may accumulate and grow in CalABLE investments with no federal or state income taxes or penalties if  

[9:2:66,392] the contributions are used to pay for qualified expenses. Funds up to $100,000 held in the ABLE account also do not affect  

[9:3:66,401] eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits, which without an ABLE account limit accumulated assets  

[9:4:66,411] of beneficiaries to $2,000.  

[10:0:66,429] In 2022, Governor Newsom signed AB 2216 into law, limiting state protections from Medi-Cal recovery upon the death of an  

[10:1:66,438] ABLE beneficiary, only to CalABLE account holders, and permitting CalABLE account holders who are working to contribute up  

[10:2:66,448] to the full amount allowable under the federal ABLE to Work provision. In 2023, the Governor signed AB 339 into law,  

[10:3:66,458] expanding eligibility to open a CalABLE account to individuals whose disability began before age 46. This law conforms with a  

[10:4:66,468] change in federal law and will go into effect in 2026.

[8:0:66,382] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:0:66,401] 0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,420] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance  

[10:1:66,430] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are available for loans to schools and  

[10:2:66,440] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,  

[10:3:66,450] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB  

[10:4:66,459] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.  

[11:0:66,477] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[12:0:66,496] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program  

[12:1:66,506] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the  

[12:2:66,516] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University  

[12:3:66,525] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50  

[12:4:66,535] percent state subsidy for charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the state)  

[12:5:66,545] by the charter school via a 30-year loan. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be financially sound,  

[12:6:66,555] and meet other program eligibility requirements. 

[13:0:66,572] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM  

[14:0:66,589] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA received grants under the United States Department of Education’s State Charter School  

[14:1:66,599] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.  

[14:2:66,609] Grant funds reimburse a charter school’s costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities  

[14:3:66,619] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on  

[14:4:66,628] preference points assigned based on: the percentage of low-income students; percentage of overcrowding; not-for-profit status;  

[14:5:66,638] and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. This program sunset in  

[14:6:66,648] December 2022.  

[15:0:66,665] 0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM  

[16:0:66,683] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and  

[16:1:66,692] lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged  

[16:2:66,702] students. Eligible charter schools are provided the lesser of $1,432 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, or 75 percent  

[16:3:66,712] of annual facilities rent and lease costs.  

[17:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:2:66,96] up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is  

[3:3:66,105] available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference goes to schools that have  

[3:4:66,115] not opened nor completed their full charter term.  

[3:5:66,132] 0938 - STUDENT HOUSING REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM 

[3:6:66,150] Chapter 572, Statutes of 2022 established the California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund, which provides zero-interest

[10:0:66,525] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:1:66,543] 0940 - BOND FINANCING  

[11:0:66,561] CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational  

[11:1:66,570] facilities. Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms  

[11:2:66,580] than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the  

[11:3:66,590] construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or  

[11:4:66,600] the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating  

[11:5:66,609] institution is pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private activity"  

[11:6:66,619] bond ceiling as specified in federal law.  

[12:0:66,648] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "participating private college" means a nonprofit,  

[12:1:66,658] private, regionally accredited, degree-granting college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's  

[12:2:66,668] race or ethnicity and provided that the financing does not violate constitutional provisions.  

[13:0:66,697] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,68] issue tax-exempt public offering or private placement loans for participating institutions, which may provide greater cost savings  

[3:1:66,78] than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.  

[4:0:66,98] 0951 - STUDENT HOUSING REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,115] Chapter 572, Statutes of 2022, established the California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund (CaSH RLF), which provides  

[5:1:66,125] zero-interest loans for affordable student housing and affordable faculty and staff housing.  

[6:0:66,152] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND  

[7:0:66,169] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the  

[7:1:66,179] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,  

[7:2:66,189] added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January  

[7:3:66,198] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax  

[7:4:66,208] credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.   Chapter 976, Statues of 2022,  

[7:5:66,218] extended CEFA’s responsibility further to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2028.   Chapter 278, Statutes of 2023,  

[7:6:66,228] altered the target student population that the Fund could benefit from students that receive Cal Grant B awards to qualifying  

[7:7:66,237] community college student transfers to regionally accredited Historically Black Colleges and Universities that have an associate  

[7:8:66,247] degree for transfer memorandum of understanding on file with the office of the Chancellor of the California Community
