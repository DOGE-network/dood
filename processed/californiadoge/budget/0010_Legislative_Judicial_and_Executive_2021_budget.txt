[6:1:66,229] The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and  

[6:2:66,239] establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal  

[6:3:66,250] and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  

[6:4:66,267] Because the Legislature's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to  

[6:5:66,278] support this need.   For the specifics on the Legislature's   capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,69] The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was  

[3:1:66,79] completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for  

[3:2:66,89] construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.   The Annex, which was  

[3:3:66,99] completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices.  

[3:4:66,117] Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored,  

[3:5:66,127] rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

[10:0:139,471] 0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System  

[10:1:66,492] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional  

[10:2:66,502] officers, and legislative statutory officers.  

[11:0:66,523] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of  

[11:1:66,533] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,  

[11:2:66,543] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.   The Legislators'  

[11:3:66,553] Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 

[12:0:66,574] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November  

[12:1:66,584] 6, 1990.   Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340)  

[12:2:66,594] closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory  

[12:3:66,604] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[6:1:66,224] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members  

[6:2:66,234] and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The  

[6:3:66,244] legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending meetings of legislative committees as  

[6:4:66,255] counsel, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is confidential.  

[7:0:66,275] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative  

[7:1:66,285] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes.  

[8:0:66,306] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative  

[8:1:66,316] information system and the processing of legislative measures.  

[9:0:66,336] Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the  

[9:1:66,346] Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws recommended by the  

[9:2:66,357] National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these uniform acts.  

[9:3:66,374] Pursuant to Chapter 450 of the Statutes of 2018, the Bureau provides advice and investigation services to the Legislature  

[9:4:66,384] related to workplace misconduct through the Workplace Conduct Unit.

[1:0:382,13] LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[2:0:173,32] 0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] †   Fiscal year 2019-20 budget information reflects the latest available estimates for this department and/or fund(s). Changes  

[3:1:66,83] resulting from the final reconciliation of the 2019-20 ending fund balance will be reflected as a prior year adjustment in the  

[3:2:66,93] 2022-23 Governor’s Budget publication.  

[4:0:242,131] 0250   Judicial Branch  

[5:0:66,153] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of  

[5:1:66,163] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.  

[5:2:66,173] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially  

[5:3:66,183] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.  

[6:0:66,204] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent  

[6:1:66,214] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was  

[6:2:66,224] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This  

[7:0:66,234] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The  

[7:1:66,245] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty  

[8:0:66,255] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments  

[8:1:66,265] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted  

[8:2:66,275] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act  

[8:3:66,285] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the  

[8:4:66,296] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial  

[8:5:66,306] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are  

[8:6:66,316] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of  

[8:7:66,326] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities  

[8:8:66,336] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.  

[9:0:66,357] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,  

[9:1:66,367] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United  

[9:2:66,377] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.  

[10:0:66,398] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay  

[10:1:66,408] program to support this need. For   the specifics on   the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[25:0:55,628] 1/ Reflects the 2019-20 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the trial courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for 2019-20. Non-

[25:1:55,634] state funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[26:0:55,641] 2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees. 

[26:1:55,650] 3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 trial courts based on courts' 2020-21 Schedule 1 submissions, and includes both preliminary and certified submissions. 

[27:0:55,658] 4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation. 

[28:0:55,666] 5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not  

[28:1:55,673] included in the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1. 

[29:0:55,680] 6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported  

[29:1:55,686] in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not  

[29:2:55,692] Distributed to Trial Courts" (Figure 2) amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for the "State Trial Court Funding Total." 

[30:0:55,699] 7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  

[30:1:55,705] For the current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[31:0:55,712] 8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2019-20 and estimated expenditures for 2020-21 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2020-21 Enacted Budget.

[19:0:39,315] 1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, GF, and JBWCF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state  

[19:1:39,323] operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). 

[20:0:39,332] 2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding,  

[20:1:39,340] Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount  

[20:2:39,347] in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1).  

[21:0:39,359] 3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid, excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" (Figure 1)  

[21:1:39,367] revenue amounts reported ($145.9 million in 2019-20 and $140.4 million in 2020-21). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the  

[21:2:39,374] TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2019-20 and 2020-21 participated in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF. 

[22:0:39,387] 4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training  

[22:1:39,395] (DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects 

[23:0:39,405] the appropriated funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program. 

[24:0:39,417] 5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred  

[24:1:39,425] to the JBWCF. For the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF. 

[25:0:39,437] 6/ The 2020-21 estimated rent is incorporated into the request from each program that houses employees.

[4:2:66,126] Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations  

[4:3:66,136] for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of  

[4:4:66,146] statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the  

[4:5:66,156] Supreme Court.

[10:2:66,621] court to avoid case delay.  

[10:3:66,639] 0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS

[12:0:66,546] The Judicial Branch consists of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, trial courts, and the Judicial Council. The Supreme Court  

[12:1:66,556] is located in the 103,300 square foot (sf) Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco and the 7,600 sf Ronald Reagan State Building in  

[12:2:66,567] Los Angeles. The courts of appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of  

[12:3:66,577] approximately 508,000 sf. The trial courts are located in 58 counties statewide, in approximately 450 facilities, and 2,100  

[12:4:66,587] courtrooms of approximately 16 million sf of usable area and more than 21 million sf of space under Judicial Council  

[12:5:66,597] responsibility and management. The facilities of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and trial courts encompass not only the  

[12:6:66,607] public courtroom spaces but also the chambers and workspaces where judicial officers and courtroom staff prepare for  

[12:7:66,618] proceedings; secure areas, including holding cells; and building support functions. Judicial Council administrative facilities,  

[12:8:66,628] occupying approximately 250,000 sf, are located in San Francisco and Sacramento.

[10:0:180,488] 0280   Commission on Judicial Performance  

[11:0:66,509] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of  

[11:1:66,519] judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California  

[11:2:66,530] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of  

[11:3:66,540] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or  

[11:4:66,550] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.  

[11:5:66,560] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.  

[12:0:66,581] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial  

[12:1:66,591] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation  

[12:2:66,601] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal  

[12:3:66,611] from office.  

[13:0:66,632] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the  

[13:1:66,642] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,  

[13:2:66,652] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.  

[13:3:66,662] Commission members do not receive a salary.  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[5:0:150,155] 0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System  

[6:0:66,177] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and  

[6:1:66,187] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement  

[6:2:66,197] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.  

[7:0:66,215] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in  

[7:1:66,225] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System  

[7:2:66,235] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final  

[7:3:66,245] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement  

[7:4:66,256] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of  

[7:5:66,266] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined  

[7:6:66,276] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives  

[7:7:66,286] contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted  

[7:8:66,296] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.  

[8:0:66,317] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,  

[9:0:66,327] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges  

[9:1:66,337] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing  

[9:2:66,347] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit  

[9:3:66,358] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the  

[9:4:66,368] required benefit payments to retired judges.  

[10:0:66,388] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of  

[10:1:66,398] 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[6:0:195,288] 0650   Office of Planning and Research  

[7:0:66,309] The Office of Planning and Research (OPR) assists the Governor and the Administration in planning, research, policy  

[8:0:66,319] development, and legislative analysis. OPR formulates long-range state goals and policies to address four key areas: land use  

[8:1:66,330] and planning, climate risk and resilience, sustainable economic development, and targeted long-range research needs. OPR  

[8:2:66,340] acts as the state's liaison to a variety of entities including local and regional government, planning professionals, small  

[8:3:66,350] business, and the Department of Defense. OPR also serves a role as convener across multiple agencies on cross-cutting  

[8:4:66,360] issues in the four key areas of our work.  

[9:0:66,381] The Office of Planning and Research includes three main budget programs: the State Policy Program (often referred to as  

[9:1:66,391] OPR), which houses most of core planning and research functions; the California Strategic Growth Council, which coordinates  

[9:2:66,401] and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and stakeholders to realize healthy, thriving, resilient communities  

[9:3:66,411] for all and provides direct grant funding to projects demonstrating the value and feasibility of sustainable communities; and  

[9:4:66,421] California Volunteers, a program aimed to increase the number and impact of Californians involved with service and  

[9:5:66,432] volunteering throughout the state.

[12:0:66,570] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency  

[12:1:66,580] response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's  

[12:2:66,590] Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's  

[12:3:66,600] homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for,  

[12:4:66,611] protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats.  

[12:5:66,628] Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal  

[12:6:66,638] agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in  

[12:7:66,649] emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own  

[12:8:66,659] resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the  

[12:9:66,669] federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.  

[12:10:66,687] During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's  

[12:11:66,697] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal  

[12:12:66,707] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the

[3:0:66,69] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes  

[3:1:66,79] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  

[4:0:66,97] Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and  

[4:1:66,107] the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS  

[4:2:66,117] assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of   and response to criminal and terrorist activity and   also facilitates  

[4:3:66,127] information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners.  

[5:0:66,145] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety   Commission   is a separate unit within the   Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to  

[5:1:66,155] lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well  

[5:2:66,165] as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management.  

[5:3:66,183] Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this  

[5:4:66,193] need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[4:1:76,118] provided $21.9 million one-time General Fund in 2020-21 as a part of a comprehensive package to increase the pace and  

[4:2:76,128] scale of forest health activities and reduce wildfire risk. In total, the Budget includes a $1.5 billion wildfire prevention and  

[4:3:76,138] forest resilience investment over three years ($536 million in 2020 21, $458 million in 2021-22, and $500 million in 2022 23).  

[4:4:76,148] Allocations for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 budgets will be determined in subsequent legislation.  

[5:0:65,164] • Building Resilience—The Budget includes $100 million one-time General Fund for   Community Hardening to Build Disaster  

[5:1:76,175] Resilient Communities. Specifically, this funding will support community hardening efforts within under-resourced

[5:3:76,195] and providing outreach and technical assistance to disadvantaged local communities and governments as they apply for  

[5:4:76,205] federal grants.  

[6:0:65,221] • Victims of Crime Act Supplemental Funding—The Budget includes $100 million one-time General Fund to supplement  

[6:1:76,232] federal funding supporting a variety of services for domestic violence victims. This one-time augmentation will allow existing

[9:1:85,363] establish a new Office of Equity and make permanent an annual $25 million Listos California grant program to further

[11:1:85,426] to establish a new unit within Cal OES to better coordinate and lead the state’s disaster cost tracking and reporting efforts  

[11:2:85,436] in coordination with all state agencies. This new unit will serve as a liaison. 

[12:0:65,460] • Nonprofit Security Grant Program—The Budget includes $50 million one-time General Fund for the California State Nonprofit  

[12:1:76,470] Security Grant Program, to assist nonprofit organizations that have historically been targets of hate-motivated violence. This  

[12:2:76,481] program, administered by the Cal OES, provides support for target hardening and other physical security enhancements to  

[12:3:76,491] nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of violence and hate crimes based on ideology and beliefs.  

[13:0:65,507] • Long Term Recovery Support—The Budget includes $37.8 million ($15.7 million General Fund) ongoing to provide  

[13:1:76,517] permanent funding for 104 permanent recovery positions provided in 2018 with three-year limited-term funding, and 110 new  

[13:2:76,527] positions to better support California’s recovery efforts and recoupment of eligible federal disaster cost reimbursements for  

[13:3:76,538] the state and local governments, and to maximize the hazard mitigation program to mitigate the impacts of future disasters  

[13:4:76,548] on the state and local jurisdictions.  

[14:0:65,564] • COVID-19 Direct Response Expenditures—The Budget includes a total of $1.7 billion for various state departments for direct

[14:4:76,605] activities.  

[15:0:65,621] • California Earthquake Early Warning System—The Budget includes $17.3 million one-time General Fund to continue to  

[15:1:76,631] support system operations and program management, an education and outreach campaign, and research and development  

[15:2:76,641] to expand earthquake mitigation use of the system.  

[16:0:65,658] • Gun Violence Restraining Orders—The Budget includes $11 million one-time General Fund to facilitate education and  

[16:1:76,668] training efforts related to gun violence restraining orders. This funding includes: (1) $5 million for to conduct a public

[4:0:65,105] • Regional Hazardous Materials Response—The Budget includes $3.6 million ongoing General Fund to continue  

[4:1:76,115] implementation of the Regional Hazardous Materials Response program, which strategically positions and trains response  

[4:2:76,126] teams throughout the state in high risk areas to respond to hazardous material incidents.  

[4:3:65,142] • Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center (SB 209)—The Budget includes $7.5 million General Fund in  

[4:4:76,152] 2021-22, $4.5 million ongoing General Fund, and 22 positions for Cal OES, California Military Department, Department of  

[4:5:76,162] Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), and Public Utilities Commission to implement Chapter 405, Statutes of 2019 (SB  

[4:6:76,172] 209) which requires Cal OES and CAL FIRE to establish a Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center  

[4:7:76,183] (Wildfire Forecast Center). The Wildfire Forecast Center will: (1) provide “real time” intelligence and data regarding wildfire  

[4:8:76,193] threats to government agencies; (2) develop intelligence products for public and private entities involved in wildfire risk  

[4:9:76,203] mitigation efforts; and (3) serve as a central organizing hub for wildfire forecasting, weather information, threat intelligence

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES  

[5:0:66,105] Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program  

[5:1:66,115] coordinates the provision   of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended  

[5:2:66,126] in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-

[5:3:66,136] hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National  

[5:4:66,146] Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this  

[5:5:66,156] program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to  

[5:6:66,166] all hazards.  

[6:0:66,184] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,202] Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services  

[7:1:66,212] grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland  

[7:2:66,222] Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency  

[7:3:66,232] management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant  

[7:4:66,243] management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with  

[7:5:66,253] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the  

[7:6:66,263] centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion  

[7:7:66,273] center.  

[8:0:66,291] 0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION  

[9:0:66,309] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent  

[9:1:66,319] earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s  

[9:2:66,329] progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.   The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate,  

[9:3:66,339] and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.   The  

[9:4:66,349] Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support  

[9:5:66,360] the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.   These activities include: (1) developing and  

[9:6:66,370] reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related  

[9:7:66,380] legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies,  

[9:8:66,390] where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and  

[9:9:66,400] supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery.  

[10:0:66,418] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS  

[11:0:66,439] The Public Safety Communications   program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the  

[11:1:66,449] state's   public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The   program is dedicated to the  

[11:2:66,459] preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that  

[11:3:66,469] keep the public connected during times of crisis.  

[12:0:66,487] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE  

[13:0:66,507] The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of   Cal OES and support services such as  

[13:1:66,517] accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

[8:0:66,477] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[9:0:66,496] The Department of Justice (DOJ) has 96 facilities statewide totaling 1.8 million square feet, of which 14 facilities and 1.2 million  

[9:1:66,506] square feet are state-owned locations.   The remaining facilities are leased from non-state entities. 

[10:0:66,524] These facilities support the constitutional office of the Attorney General who, as Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the state, has  

[10:1:66,534] the responsibility to see that the laws of California are uniformly and adequately enforced. This responsibility is fulfilled through  

[10:2:66,544] the diverse legal, law enforcement and criminal justice information programs of the DOJ.  

[11:0:242,580] 0840   State Controller  

[12:0:66,601] The State Controller is the chief fiscal officer of California, the fifth largest economy in the world. Principally responsible for  

[12:1:66,612] transparency and accountability of the state's financial resources, the Controller ensures the appropriate disbursement and  

[12:2:66,622] tracking of taxpayer dollars. The Controller serves on dozens of state boards, commissions, and committees with  

[12:3:66,632] duties   ranging from   administrative oversight of the nation's two largest public pension funds,   to protection of state lands and  

[12:4:66,642] coastlines,   to modernization and financing of major infrastructure. The Controller also offers fiscal guidance to local  

[12:5:66,652] governments and has independent auditing authority over government agencies related to the spending of state funds. The  

[12:6:66,663] Controller's primary objectives are to:  

[13:0:65,680] • Account for and control disbursement of all state funds, issuing warrants in payment of the state's bills, including lottery  

[13:1:76,691] prizes.  

[14:0:65,707] • Determine legality and accuracy of financial claims against the state.

[1:0:382,13] LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[2:0:181,32] 0845   Department of Insurance - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to ensure   they can provide the  

[3:1:66,79] benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and  

[3:2:66,89] underlying assumptions to avoid reliance on “black box” models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurance  

[3:3:66,99] companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty insurance rates  

[3:4:66,109] are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code and the California Code  

[3:5:66,120] of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance sector; (6) review health  

[3:6:66,130] insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance companies to get  

[3:7:66,140] unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases are actuarially  

[3:8:66,150] justified and not excessive; (8) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and  

[3:9:66,160] maintain the qualifications for licensure. Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance  

[3:10:66,171] companies through the Conservation and Liquidation Office.  

[3:11:66,188] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION  

[4:0:66,209] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders  

[4:1:66,219] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or  

[4:2:66,229] underwriting by insurers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent practices or  

[4:3:66,239] incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities and (4)  

[4:4:66,250] assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community service organizations, and neighborhood  

[4:5:66,260] associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed informational guides, workshops, seminars,  

[4:6:66,270] roundtables and town halls.  

[4:7:66,288] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL  

[5:0:66,305] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for  

[5:1:66,316] prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace  

[5:2:66,326] officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the  

[5:3:66,336] Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition,  

[5:4:66,346] the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against  

[5:5:66,356] perpetrators of insurance fraud.  

[6:0:66,374] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE  

[7:0:66,392] This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws  

[7:1:66,402] contained in the Insurance Code and Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and Fee  

[7:2:66,412] Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the premium  

[7:3:66,422] tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

[6:0:183,281] 0850   California State Lottery Commission  

[7:0:66,303] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an  

[7:1:66,313] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it  

[7:2:66,323] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to  

[7:3:66,333] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by  

[7:4:66,343] the State Senate.  

[8:0:66,361] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34  

[8:1:66,371] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be  

[8:2:66,382] used for administrative costs.  

[9:0:66,399] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost  

[9:1:66,409] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of  

[9:2:66,420] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery  

[9:3:66,430] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily  

[9:4:66,440] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the  

[9:5:66,450] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.  

[9:6:66,468] In the 35 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2020, the California State Lottery has raised $37.6 billion  

[9:7:66,478] for public education, including approximately $1.5 billion in FY 2019-20.  

[10:0:66,496] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2020-21 and 2021-22 cannot be made

[2:4:66,128] Commission also has jurisdiction over gaming policies, regulations, criteria, and standards.  

[3:0:66,146] There are 86 licensed cardrooms in California over which the Commission has broad regulatory and adjudicatory authority. This  

[3:1:66,156] authority extends to the operation, concentration, and supervision of the cardrooms and all persons and things related to each  

[3:2:66,166] licensed establishment.  

[4:0:66,184] The Commission has fiduciary, regulatory, and administrative responsibilities related to Tribal gaming that include: (1)  

[4:1:66,194] distributing specified Tribal gaming revenues to Non-Compact, Non-Gaming and Limited-Gaming Tribes; (2) making suitability

[8:0:66,354] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:1:66,373] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES  

[9:0:66,393] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption.  

[9:1:66,404] During the 2019-20 fiscal year, this Division handled 8,964 security investment transactions totaling $415.4 billion. The Pooled  

[9:2:66,414] Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 7,687 of these transactions totaling $383.5 billion; time deposits  

[9:3:66,424] accounted for 1,002 transactions totaling $27.1 billion. The remaining $4.8 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special  

[9:4:66,434] funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's  

[9:5:66,444] retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment  

[9:6:66,455] program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the  

[9:7:66,465] 2019-20 fiscal year, 2,362 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $27.3 billion for the fiscal year.  

[9:8:66,482] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT  

[10:0:66,500] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System  

[10:1:66,510] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires  

[10:2:66,521] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,  

[10:3:66,531] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,  

[10:4:66,541] and loans to the General Fund.  

[11:0:66,559] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of  

[11:1:66,569] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that  

[11:2:66,579] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer  

[11:3:66,589] maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for  

[11:4:66,599] the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies.  

[12:0:66,617] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts  

[12:1:66,627] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer  

[12:2:66,638] of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for  

[12:3:66,648] payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities  

[12:4:66,658] pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other  

[12:5:66,668] state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or  

[12:6:66,678] pledged to the state.

[2:0:208,32] 0950   State Treasurer - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes,  

[3:1:66,79] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The  

[3:2:66,89] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to  

[3:3:66,99] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.  

[4:0:66,120] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse  

[4:1:66,130] consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance   includes monitoring  

[4:2:66,140] the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and  

[4:3:66,150] ensuring proper record keeping.  

[5:0:66,168] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES  

[6:0:66,186] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support  

[6:1:66,196] services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems,

[8:0:165,377] 0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee  

[8:1:66,399] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State  

[8:2:66,409] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,  

[8:3:66,419] such as the creation of affordable housing.  

[9:0:66,439] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual  

[9:1:66,450] basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by  

[9:2:66,460] multiplying the state population by $105. California's limit totaled over $4.1 billion in 2020. (California's limit for the Qualified  

[9:3:66,470] Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $395  

[9:4:66,480] million for 2020.)  

[10:0:66,501] The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers  

[10:1:66,511] authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state  

[10:2:66,521] or federal government.  

[11:0:66,541] The Committee administers five active programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private  

[11:1:66,552] activity bonds.   The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the  

[11:2:66,562] Governor, or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

[9:0:66,374] 0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[10:0:66,394] To lower the cost of financing, specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that  

[10:1:66,404] support below-market interest rate mortgage loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that reduce a homebuyer's federal  

[10:2:66,414] tax liability. Below is a summary of each program:  

[11:0:66,435] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily  

[11:1:66,445] rental housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers  

[11:2:66,455] produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and  

[11:3:66,465] families. To qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or  

[11:4:66,476] reserve at least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can  

[11:5:66,486] apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit  

[11:6:66,496] Allocation Committee Joint Application.  

[12:0:66,516] Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs to assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes.  

[12:1:66,527] Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program  

[12:2:66,537] participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations.  

[13:0:66,557] Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds  

[13:1:66,567] issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and  

[13:2:66,578] midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their  

[13:3:66,588] communities.  

[14:0:66,608] Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance any of the following facilities identified by the IRS  

[14:1:66,618] as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities,  

[14:2:66,629] high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the  

[14:3:66,639] project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to  

[14:4:66,649] protect and enhance the environment.  

[15:0:66,669] Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the construction,  

[15:1:66,680] renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities.

[5:0:66,126] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,145] 0820 - CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY  

[7:0:66,166] The Authority was established to assist transportation agencies in obtaining financing to develop transportation projects. To  

[7:1:66,176] meet this objective, statutes allow the Authority to issue, or to approve specified project sponsors to issue revenue bonds to  

[7:2:66,186] fund transportation projects backed in whole or in part, by various revenue streams of transportation funds (including toll  

[7:3:66,196] revenues). Statutes provide the authority to approve the imposition and collection of tolls on proposed transportation projects  

[7:4:66,207] under certain conditions. The planning, programming, and allocation of transportation projects are performed by the California  

[7:5:66,217] Transportation Commission and the California Department of Transportation, as appropriate.  

[8:0:166,254] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee  

[9:0:66,276] The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and  

[9:1:66,286] maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming  

[9:2:66,296] partnerships with developers, investors and public entities.  

[10:0:66,316] The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years  

[10:1:66,327] after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with federal and state tax credit program requirements of the Committee.  

[10:2:66,337] Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create and  

[10:3:66,347] maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing.  

[11:0:66,367] The Committee consists of seven members, including five voting members and two advisors. The voting members are the  

[11:1:66,378] Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her  

[11:2:66,388] representative), the State Controller, the Director of Housing and Community Development, and the Executive Director of the  

[11:3:66,398] California Housing Finance Agency. The non-voting (advisory) members are two local government representatives. One local  

[11:4:66,408] representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a county  

[11:5:66,418] government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

[6:0:66,278] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:1:66,297] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[7:0:66,317] The Federal Program  

[8:0:66,338] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax  

[8:1:66,348] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise  

[8:2:66,358] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and  

[8:3:66,368] indexed for inflation. 

[9:0:66,389] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the  

[9:1:66,399] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability  

[9:2:66,409] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of  

[9:3:66,419] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project  

[9:4:66,429] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each  

[9:5:66,440] year for a ten-year period.  

[10:0:66,457] The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation.   For 2020, each  

[10:1:66,468] state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.81 per   state resident.   Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share  

[10:2:66,478] of unused credits in a national pool.  

[11:0:66,495] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects  

[11:1:66,506] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there  

[11:2:66,516] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments.  

[11:3:66,534] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires  

[11:4:66,544] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.  

[12:0:66,572] The State LIHTC Program  

[13:0:66,592] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the  

[13:1:66,602] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for  

[13:2:66,612] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax  

[13:3:66,623] credit status.  

[14:0:66,643] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2020, was $102.7 million. Investors take the state tax credit  

[14:1:66,653] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.  

[15:0:66,671] Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit  

[15:1:66,681] Allocation Committee to   issue an additional $500 million in state tax credits in 2020 to be paired with the 4% federal program to  

[15:2:66,691] bolster new construction of low income housing. Per AB 83, this $500 million tax credit will be issued in 2021 pursuant to an  

[15:3:66,702] authorization in the   annual Budget Act or related legislation.

[3:0:66,69] Farmworker Housing Program  

[4:0:66,89] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state  

[4:1:66,99] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,  

[4:2:66,109] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and  

[4:3:66,120] projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.

[2:0:88,32] 0971   California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing 

[2:1:244,47] Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes  

[3:1:66,79] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently  

[3:2:66,89] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the  

[3:3:66,99] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  

[3:4:66,109] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,  

[3:5:66,120] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and  

[3:6:66,130] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit  

[3:7:66,140] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities  

[3:8:66,150] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.  

[4:0:66,171] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director  

[4:1:66,181] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,  

[4:2:66,191] and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[2:0:88,32] 0971   California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing 

[2:1:244,47] Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the  

[3:1:66,79] Authority,   loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and  

[3:2:66,89] approved by resolution of the Authority.  

[4:0:66,107] The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and  

[4:1:66,117] private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects  

[4:2:66,127] in California.  

[5:0:66,148] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative  

[5:1:66,158] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program   expanded   (Chapter 677, Statutes of  

[5:2:66,168] 2012)   to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes  

[5:3:66,178] of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment  

[5:4:66,188] that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product.   In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended  

[5:5:66,199] the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria  

[5:6:66,209] by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. The objective of this program is to promote the creation of California-based  

[5:7:66,219] manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy  

[5:8:66,229] consumption.  

[6:0:66,250] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013  

[6:1:66,260] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority  

[6:2:66,270] developed a loan loss reserve program   for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and   a risk  

[6:3:66,280] mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. Programs to support low-interest  

[6:4:66,290] financing of Property Assessed Clean Energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings are in discussion.  

[7:0:66,311] The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in  

[7:1:66,321] collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission   to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot programs   to  

[7:2:66,331] encourage and leverage private capital lending   (in both the residential and commercial sectors). These programs   employ  

[7:3:66,341] various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making   energy efficiency  

[7:4:66,352] improvements   to help achieve the state's   energy efficiency and decarbonization   goals. The residential pilot, launched in 2016,  

[7:5:66,362] has now transitioned to a full program.

[13:0:66,605] 0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM  

[14:0:66,626] The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the  

[14:1:66,636] acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment,  

[14:2:66,646] waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority  

[14:3:66,656] assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989,  

[14:4:66,667] the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of  

[14:5:66,677] 2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). As of June 30, 2020, bonds totaling approximately $16.4  

[14:6:66,687] billion have been issued by the Authority.

[1:0:410,13] 2021-22 STATE BUDGET — LJE   239 

[2:0:116,32] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The objective of this program is to   inspire banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. CalCAP for  

[3:1:66,79] Small Business provides a form of loan loss recovery with up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By participating  

[3:2:66,89] in CalCAP, lenders have   available to them a   proven financing mechanism to assist the financing needs of California's small  

[3:3:66,99] businesses. The program works through   the creation of   a loan loss-reserve fund specific to each   participating financial  

[3:4:66,109] institution. The Authority, financial institution, and borrower all contribute to fund the reserve. The Authority provides  

[4:0:66,120] additional   incentives for   lending to businesses located in underserved communities and disaster areas. The reserve serves to  

[4:1:66,130] reduce loan-loss risk, encouraging   banks to lend to targeted California small businesses.  

[5:0:66,148] Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA's Small Business Assistance Fund  

[5:1:66,158] (SBAF) established   with fees collected from large companies financed through CPCFA's   tax-exempt bond program.   In October  

[5:2:66,168] 2010, Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million from the General Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts.   The  

[5:3:66,178] $6 million appropriation   was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to become the  

[5:4:66,188] primary source for the State's contributions.  

[6:0:66,209] In   2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from the federal State Small  

[6:1:66,219] Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The allocation was shared between the Authority, $85 million, and   the Governor's Office of  

[6:2:66,229] Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz), $83   million.   These funds enabled the Authority to expand the availability of its  

[6:3:66,239] CalCAP for Small Business   statewide.   The Authority also launched the   Collateral Support Program   to   offset lenders resistance  

[6:4:66,250] to lend after the 2008 recession.   The federal funds   were expended by the fourth quarter of 2018, allowing for all recaptured  

[6:5:66,260] funds to stay with its state.   Funds are being   recaptured annually to sustain both the State CalCAP for Small Business and the  

[6:6:66,270] Collateral Support Program.  

[7:0:66,290] Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority   partnered with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist   truck and bus  

[7:1:66,301] owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds  

[7:2:66,311] to incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that   comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The Authority   also partnered  

[7:3:66,321] with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit enhancements and rebates to  

[7:4:66,331] small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to   install electric vehicle charging stations.  

[8:0:66,349] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,369] The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived  

[9:1:66,379] contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties  

[9:2:66,390] (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program  

[9:3:66,400] provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with  

[9:4:66,410] brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible  

[9:5:66,420] projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or  

[9:6:66,430] perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process.  

[10:0:66,451] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund  

[11:0:66,461] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received  

[11:1:66,471] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project   for   brownfield remediation that  

[11:2:66,481] promoted affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. In one instance, CALReUSE provided a grant in excess of  

[11:3:66,492] $5 million in order to utilize returned funds.   All CALReUSE Program funds have been awarded. The CALReUSE Program's  

[11:4:66,502] $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,587 housing units, of which more than 47% will be  

[11:5:66,512] affordable, in 30 California communities.  

[12:0:66,530] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS  

[13:0:66,547] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative  

[13:1:66,558] energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's  

[13:2:66,568] environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and  

[13:3:66,578] state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.  

[14:0:66,596] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT  

[15:0:66,616] The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal  

[15:1:66,626] Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for   employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other financial  

[15:2:66,637] institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the Authority an  

[15:3:66,647] appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the CalCAP  

[15:4:66,657] model   incentivizing lenders to enroll qualifying loans.   The program also offers borrowers a rebate toward the cost of the  

[15:5:66,667] Certified Access Specialist (CASp) Report.  

[16:0:66,685] 0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,705] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time  

[17:1:66,715] allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement   program for   qualified small businesses  

[18:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[9:0:66,497] In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3  

[9:1:66,507] established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program.  

[9:2:66,517] The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable  

[9:3:66,527] and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals and, under Proposition 4, hospitals that  

[9:4:66,538] provide pediatric services for children eligible for California Children’s Services. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is  

[9:5:66,548] derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition  

[9:6:66,558] 3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4.

[10:3:66,379] counties, the program funds facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs for

[10:5:66,407] • No Place Like Home Program  

[11:0:66,424] Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home Program (NPLH), which requires the Department

[11:5:66,475] Program. Chapter 41, Statutes of 2018 (AB 1827) placed the No Place Like Home program on the November 2018 ballot  

[11:6:66,486] (Proposition 2), where it was adopted by the voters as the No Place Like Home Act. This ratified existing law establishing the  

[11:7:66,496] No Place Like Home program as being consistent with the Mental Health Services Act approved through Proposition 63 in

[11:1:66,541] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD  

[12:0:66,561] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which  

[12:1:66,571] allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can  

[12:2:66,582] make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings.  

[12:3:66,592] ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability  

[12:4:66,602] expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the  

[12:5:66,612] State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.  

[13:0:66,633] The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the  

[13:1:66,643] purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse  

[13:2:66,653] needs of our customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in  

[13:3:66,663] providing financial services.  

[14:0:66,681] Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $15,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's  

[14:1:66,691] ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.

[6:0:66,393] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:1:66,413] 0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,433] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance  

[7:1:66,443] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and  

[7:2:66,453] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,  

[7:3:66,464] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB  

[7:4:66,474] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.  

[7:5:66,491] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,512] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program  

[8:1:66,522] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the  

[8:2:66,532] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University  

[8:3:66,542] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50  

[8:4:66,553] percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the  

[8:5:66,563] state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be  

[8:6:66,573] deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements.  

[8:7:66,591] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,611] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School  

[9:1:66,621] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.  

[9:2:66,632] Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities  

[9:3:66,642] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on  

[9:4:66,652] preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and  

[9:5:66,662] demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding.  

[9:6:66,680] 0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,700] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and  

[10:1:66,710] lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged  

[11:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:2:66,97] 0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND  

[4:0:66,117] Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of  

[4:1:66,127] up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is  

[4:2:66,137] available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference is given to schools that  

[4:3:66,148] have not opened nor   completed their full charter term.

[5:0:66,243] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,262] 0940 - BOND FINANCING  

[6:0:66,280] CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational  

[6:1:66,290] facilities.   Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds,   CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms  

[6:2:66,300] than might otherwise be obtainable.   CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the  

[6:3:66,310] construction of student and faculty housing.   Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or  

[6:4:66,320] the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions.   The full faith and credit of the participating  

[6:5:66,331] institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds.   Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private  

[6:6:66,341] activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law.  

[7:0:66,359] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private  

[7:1:66,369] college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's ethnicity, provided that the financing does not  

[7:2:66,379] violate constitutional provisions.  

[8:0:66,399] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness.   This broad definition allows CEFA to  

[8:1:66,409] issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than  

[8:2:66,419] these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.  

[9:0:66,439] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND  

[10:0:66,459] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the  

[10:1:66,470] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017.   Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,  

[10:2:66,480] added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January  

[10:3:66,490] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018.   Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax  

[10:4:66,500] credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
