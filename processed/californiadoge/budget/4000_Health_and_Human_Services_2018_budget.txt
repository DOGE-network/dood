[1:0:228,43] 4170   Department of Aging 

[1:1:66,64] The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, and 

[1:2:66,74] families through: 

[2:0:65,92] •   Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives, 

[2:1:65,108] •   Opportunities for community involvement, 

[2:2:65,124] •   Support to family members providing care, and 

[2:3:65,141] •   Collaboration with other state and local agencies. 

[3:0:66,158] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that 

[3:1:66,168] provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and 

[3:2:66,179] Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate 

[3:3:66,189] the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-

[3:4:66,199] Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid. 

[4:0:66,217] The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the 

[4:1:66,227] local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults 

[4:2:66,237] with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

[11:0:66,600] The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60 

[11:1:66,610] years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the 

[11:2:66,620] isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and 

[11:3:66,630] assistance, employment, and education. 

[11:4:66,648] 3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 

[12:0:66,666] The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized 

[12:1:66,676] training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also 

[12:2:66,686] promotes transition to unsubsidized employment.

[1:0:419,24] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:193,38] 4170   Department of Aging - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 

[3:1:66,75] grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance, 

[3:2:66,85] legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term 

[3:3:66,95] Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support 

[3:4:66,106] necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care 

[3:5:66,116] services appropriate to their needs. 

[4:0:66,134] 3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 

[5:0:66,151] This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides 

[5:1:66,161] personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local 

[5:2:66,172] source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans. 

[5:3:66,189] 3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 

[6:0:66,207] This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services 

[6:1:66,217] (CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age or over who 

[6:2:66,227] are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or disabilities. The 

[6:3:66,238] Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-

[6:4:66,248] based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term 

[6:5:66,258] care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

[1:0:419,24] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:134,38] 4260   State Department of Health Care Services - Continued 

[3:0:65,65] •   CHIP Reauthorization—In February 2018, the federal government approved a ten-year extension of enhanced federal 

[3:1:76,75] funding at 88 percent through September 30, 2019, phasing down in future years to the historic ratio of 65 percent. 

[4:0:65,91] •   ACA Optional Expansion—In January of each year, the state’s cost-sharing ratio for the 3.9 million Californians in the 

[4:1:76,101] optional Medi-Cal expansion increases incrementally until it reaches 10 percent in 2020. The Budget includes $18.7 billion 

[4:2:76,112] ($1.7 billion General Fund), an increase of $803.2 million ($251 million General Fund) compared to 2017-18 for the optional 

[4:3:76,122] expansion population. 

[5:0:65,138] •   Elimination of State-Only Limits on Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment—The Budget includes $8.4 million General Fund 

[5:1:76,148] to eliminate the 18-month treatment limitation for breast cancer and 24-month treatment limitation for cervical cancer in the 

[5:2:76,158] state-only Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. 

[6:0:65,175] •   Data Collection and Sharing Initiatives—The Budget includes $50 million ($5 million General Fund) in 2018-19 for the 

[6:1:76,185] development of Health Information Exchanges to facilitate data sharing of health information between health systems. It also 

[6:2:76,195] includes funding for changes to the California Health Information Survey to study the accuracy of responses and data

[2:0:66,64] The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all 

[2:1:66,74] Californians through the following core activities: 

[3:0:65,92] •   Protecting the public from communicable diseases. 

[4:0:65,108] •   Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments. 

[5:0:65,124] •   Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities. 

[5:1:65,141] •   Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. 

[6:0:65,157] •   Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status, inform people, institutions and communities; and to 

[6:1:76,167] guide public health strategies, programs, and actions. 

[7:0:65,183] •   Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces. 

[7:1:65,199] •   Providing access to quality, population-based health services. 

[8:0:66,217] Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to

[1:0:176,43] 4300   Department of Developmental Services 

[2:0:66,64] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for 

[2:1:66,74] providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and 

[2:2:66,84] productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides 

[2:3:66,95] leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the 

[2:4:66,105] developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems 

[2:5:66,115] that arise. Services are delivered directly through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community 

[2:6:66,125] agencies known as regional centers as well as through developmental centers and a state-operated community facility. The 

[2:7:66,135] Department, through the 21 private, nonprofit regional centers, oversees coordination of services to persons with 

[2:8:66,146] developmental disabilities; provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these 

[2:9:66,156] individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home 

[2:10:66,166] community. 

[3:0:66,186] Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 

[3:1:66,197] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:2:76,151] department developing a 2019 rate study of the current methods for setting rates, including whether there is an adequate 

[3:3:76,161] supply of vendors; a comparison of the fiscal effects of alternative rate setting methods; and how vendor rates relate to 

[3:4:76,171] consumer outcomes. 

[3:5:65,187] •   Uniform Holiday Schedule Suspension—The Budget includes $29.3 million General Fund on a one-time basis to suspend

[3:8:76,224] Health, Intermediate Care Facility-Developmentally Disabled, and Pediatric Day Health Care providers. This adjustment is 

[3:9:76,234] consistent with increases provided in the Department of Health Care Services, Medi-Cal program. 

[3:10:65,250] •   Minimum Wage—The Budget includes an increase of $245.4 million ($133.7 million General Fund) in 2018-19 to reflect the

[7:0:66,327] Through the network of regional centers, the Department supports the development and maintenance of services for eligible 

[7:1:66,337] persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers directly provide or coordinate the 

[7:2:66,347] following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, (3) counseling, (4) lifelong 

[7:3:66,357] individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the individual program plan, 

[7:4:66,368] (6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of legal, civil, and service 

[7:5:66,378] rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, placement, and monitoring 

[7:6:66,388] for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, (12) community education 

[7:7:66,398] about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services. 

[8:0:66,416] 4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM 

[9:0:66,434] The Department operates three residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County), Porterville 

[10:0:66,444] Developmental Center (Tulare County), and Sonoma Developmental Center (Sonoma County). Secure treatment services are 

[10:1:66,454] provided at the Porterville Developmental Center. The Department also leases one small community facility for persons who 

[10:2:66,464] require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed facility in Cathedral City (Riverside County). The 

[10:3:66,474] residential facilities are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for skilled nursing care and intermediate 

[10:4:66,485] care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility only. Services at all facilities involve the provision of active 

[10:5:66,495] treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including appropriate medical and dental care, health 

[10:6:66,505] maintenance activities, and assistance with activities of daily living, training, education, and employment. 

[11:0:66,523] Beginning in 2018-19, the Department will operate four Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) 

[12:0:66,533] residences that provide acute crisis services in the community. Individuals served in the STAR residences are committed by a 

[12:1:66,543] court order to the Department for suitable treatment and habilitation services, and are provided services and supports 

[12:2:66,553] necessary to prepare them for return to their residential home or to transition to a new living option. 

[13:0:66,571] The primary objectives of this program include providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents 

[13:1:66,581] based upon assessed need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most 

[13:2:66,591] efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system; and 

[13:3:66,602] are designed to teach individuals skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and 

[13:4:66,612] welfare, and enhance personal competence in all areas of daily living. 

[14:0:66,630] The Developmental Centers Division provides central administrative and clinical management services to the three 

[15:0:66,640] developmental centers and the leased small community facility to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with 

[15:1:66,650] state licensing and federal certification requirements, protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility structures 

[15:2:66,660] and grounds. Areas of responsibility include the development of policy and procedures for all aspects of the developmental 

[15:3:66,670] centers operations, law enforcement and protective services, facility population management, program and fiscal oversight, and 

[15:4:66,681] facilities planning and support.

[1:0:201,43] 4440   Department of State Hospitals 

[2:0:66,64] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is 

[2:1:66,74] to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital 

[2:2:66,84] operations, across a continuum of care. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health 

[3:0:66,95] treatment for its patients in five state hospitals, and employs nearly 11,000 staff. Additionally, the Department provides services 

[3:1:66,105] in jail-based competency treatment programs and conditional release programs throughout the 58 counties. In 2016-17, State 

[3:2:66,115] Hospitals served approximately 13,000 patients, with an average daily inpatient census of approximately 7,000; and the jail-

[3:3:66,125] based competency programs served approximately 700 patients, with a daily capacity of around 200 beds. The conditional 

[3:4:66,135] release program maintains an average daily census of approximately 650. 

[4:0:66,156] The Department oversees five state hospitals, located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and Patton. 

[4:1:66,166] The psychiatric programs treating mentally-ill prisoners, operating at Vacaville, Salinas Valley, and Stockton state prisons, were 

[4:2:66,176] transferred to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as of July 1, 2017. The Department continues to 

[4:3:66,186] designate 336 beds at Atascadero, Coalinga, and Patton state hospitals for the treatment of mentally-ill Coleman class 

[4:4:66,197] prisoners. 

[5:0:66,217] Because the Department of State Hospitals' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 

[5:1:66,227] outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 

[5:2:66,237] Overview."

[5:5:66,172] treated and discharged directly from the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center. 

[5:6:66,189] 4430020 - JAIL-BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT 

[6:0:66,207] The Department of State Hospitals contracts with local entities to provide mental health services to some of its patients.   The 

[6:1:66,217] Jail-Based Competency Treatment Program focuses on defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial, and provides mental 

[6:2:66,227] health treatment to defendants in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court proceedings. 

[6:3:66,245] 4440 - FORENSIC AND EVALUATION SERVICES 

[7:0:66,263] Forensic and Evaluation Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender and the Sex Offender Commitment 

[7:1:66,273] Programs. Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of 

[7:2:66,283] Prison Terms to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs evaluations 

[7:3:66,293] to determine if individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the Mentally Disordered Offender program. These evaluations are 

[7:4:66,304] used by the Board of Parole Hearings in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of State Hospitals as a 

[7:5:66,314] condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted January 

[7:6:66,324] 1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to be sexually violent 

[7:7:66,334] predators. The Sex Offender Commitment Program administers clinical screenings and performs evaluations to determine if 

[7:8:66,344] prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for a sexually violent predator commitment to the Department of State Hospitals upon 

[7:9:66,355] completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the ultimate determination whether an individual is likely to be a sexually 

[7:10:66,365] violent predator and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department of State Hospitals.

[4:1:66,284] 4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS 

[5:0:66,302] The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through 

[5:1:66,312] financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services. 

[6:0:66,330] The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households 

[6:1:66,340] to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related 

[6:2:66,350] emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard 

[6:3:66,360] the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which 

[6:4:66,370] supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used 

[6:5:66,381] along with LIHEAP weatherization related services. 

[7:0:66,398] The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-

[7:1:66,408] income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants. 

[8:0:66,426] The Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program provides services to fully abate or control lead paint hazards in low-income 

[8:1:66,436] privately owned housing with young children. 

[9:0:66,454] The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides weatherization and renewable energy services in low-income 

[9:1:66,464] single-family and multi-family dwellings within disadvantaged communities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LIWP 

[9:2:66,474] includes projects such as weatherization and solar water heater and solar photovoltaic systems installations. 

[9:3:66,492] 4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES 

[10:0:66,510] The Community Services Block Grant is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community organizations to 

[10:1:66,520] help low-income families achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through a broad range of activities. These activities include 

[10:2:66,530] education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional 

[10:3:66,540] services. Additionally, Community Services Block Grant funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-

[2:0:170,38] 5160   Department of Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,91] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES 

[5:0:66,108] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities through 

[5:1:66,119] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state. In addition, the Department 

[5:2:66,129] has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (education, mental health, and welfare) to provide services to 

[5:3:66,139] consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, which gives priority to persons with the most 

[5:4:66,149] significant disabilities. 

[6:0:66,167] Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of 

[6:1:66,177] services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, and 

[6:2:66,187] independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities. 

[7:0:66,205] The Department provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to enable persons who are blind or visually 

[7:1:66,215] impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational services are 

[7:2:66,225] provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to newly blind adults to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation services and 

[7:3:66,236] independent living. 

[8:0:66,253] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation 

[8:1:66,263] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and 

[8:2:66,274] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 

[9:0:66,291] The Department works with the federal government to administer two grant programs. The Promoting the Readiness of Minors 

[9:1:66,302] in Supplemental Security Income grant develops projects to promote positive outcomes for children who receive Supplemental 

[9:2:66,312] Security Income and their families. The CA Innovations Program seeks to increase the self-sufficiency of students with 

[9:3:66,322] disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and planned education to prepare them for workplace success. 

[10:0:66,340] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES 

[11:0:66,357] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout 

[11:1:66,368] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently and be 

[11:2:66,378] productive in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, benefits advocacy, 

[11:3:66,388] independent living skills development, housing assistance, personal assistance services, transition services to community 

[11:4:66,398] based living, transition services to postsecondary life for youth, and personal and systems change advocacy. 

[12:0:66,416] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their 

[12:1:66,426] families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with 

[12:2:66,436] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for 

[12:3:66,446] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. 

[13:0:66,464] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 19 non-profit community-based 

[13:1:66,474] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually 

[13:2:66,485] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low 

[13:3:66,495] vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, independent living 

[13:4:66,505] skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services. 

[14:0:66,523] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION 

[15:0:66,540] The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services 

[15:1:66,551] to departmental programs.

[1:0:407,24] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — HHS   175 

[2:0:144,38] 5175   Department of Child Support Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[3:1:66,91] 4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 

[4:0:66,101] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing 

[4:1:66,111] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and 

[4:2:66,121] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-

[4:3:66,131] D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary 

[4:4:66,142] Assistance for Needy Families block grant. 

[4:5:66,159] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 

[5:0:66,177] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating 

[5:1:66,187] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The 

[5:2:66,197] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs. 

[5:3:66,215] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 

[6:0:66,233] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal 

[6:1:66,243] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State 

[6:2:66,253] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts 

[6:3:66,263] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support 

[6:4:66,274] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments 

[6:5:66,284] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program 

[6:6:66,294] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[1:0:407,24] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — HHS   179 

[2:0:166,38] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] Welfare and Institutions Code Section 18260. 

[4:0:66,83] 4285-Disability Evaluation and Other Services: 

[5:0:66,100] Federal Laws: Social Security Act (Titles II, XVI, XIX). 

[6:0:66,137] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[7:0:65,155] •   End SSI Cash-Out—The Budget includes one-time funding of $230 million General Fund to eliminate the SSI cash-out policy 

[7:1:76,166] no later than August 1, 2019, expanding federal funding for food assistance while holding harmless households potentially 

[7:2:76,176] affected by the change. Prior to this change, SSI individuals did not receive CalFresh benefits and their income was not 

[7:3:76,186] counted in the benefit calculations in a CalFresh household. These individuals instead were given a $10 monthly 

[7:4:76,196] supplemental SSI/SSP benefit. Elimination of this policy results in approximately 370,000 households becoming newly 

[7:5:76,206] eligible for CalFresh benefits, with an additional 45,000 households receiving an increase in CalFresh benefits. 

[8:0:65,223] •   Home Visiting Initiative—The Budget includes $26.7 million for a voluntary CalWORKs Home Visiting pilot program, which 

[8:1:76,233] will provide pregnant women and families with a child under the age of two with home visitation services for up to 24 months, 

[8:2:76,243] with priority given to first-time pregnant women and parents. The goal of the home visiting pilot is to help young families 

[8:3:76,253] reach self-sufficiency by improving family engagement practices, supporting healthy development of young children living in 

[8:4:76,263] poverty, and preparing parents for employment. The pilot will leverage existing, evidence-based program models currently 

[8:5:76,274] being implemented across the state. A total of $131.6 million in one-time federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 

[8:6:76,284] block grant funds is being reserved for the pilot's total costs through calendar year 2021. 

[9:0:65,300] •   CalWORKs Grant Increase—The Budget increases CalWORKs grant levels by 10 percent, beginning April 1, 2019, with 

[9:1:76,310] General Fund costs of $90.1 million in 2018-19 and $359.9 million annually thereafter. This increase will bring grant levels to 

[9:2:76,320] 45 percent of the federal poverty level.   Additional increases may be considered beyond 2018-19 until grant levels reach at 

[9:3:76,331] least 50 percent of the federal poverty level. Any such increases would be subject to an appropriation of funds. 

[10:0:65,347] •   CalWORKs Single Allocation Methodology—Compared to the 2017 Budget Act, the Budget includes an increase of $55.8 

[10:1:76,357] million TANF in 2018-19 to reflect the adoption of a revised budgeting methodology for county administration of the 

[10:2:76,367] CalWORKs eligibility determination process. This model recognizes that counties have difficulty adjusting to significant 

[10:3:76,377] increases and decreases in caseload, and attempts to smooth out the changes to county funding.   The methodology: (1) 

[10:4:76,388] establishes a fixed-base funding level that does not adjust when caseload changes, and (2) includes a variable component 

[10:5:76,398] that adjusts when caseload increases or decreases by 5 percent or more, compared to the 2018-19 caseload.   An additional 

[10:6:76,408] one-time $23.5 million General Fund is included for Employment Services, effectively holding the total 2018-19 Single 

[10:7:76,418] Allocation level to the 2017 Budget Act level.   The Administration intends to evaluate the budgeting methodology for the 

[10:8:76,428] Employment Services during 2019-20 budget development. 

[11:0:65,445] •   Safety Net Reserve—The Budget establishes a Safety Net Reserve Fund for CalWORKs and Medi-Cal to maintain program 

[11:1:76,455] services and benefits in economic downturns. The Budget includes an initial transfer of $200 million from the General Fund 

[11:2:76,465] to the Safety Net Reserve Fund, CalWORKs Subaccount. The Department of Finance, in consultation with DSS, DHCS, and 

[11:3:76,475] the Legislative Analyst’s Office, will present a methodology to the Legislature to determine future transfers to and 

[11:4:76,485] distributions from the fund. 

[12:0:65,502] •   IHSS County Administration—The Budget includes $51.8 million General Fund for county IHSS administrative costs in 

[12:1:76,512] 2018-19. The increased funding reflects revised IHSS workload assumptions developed in consultation with representatives 

[12:2:76,522] of counties.   The Budget includes an additional one-time augmentation of $15.4 million General Fund for county 

[12:3:76,532] administration. 

[13:0:65,548] •   Services to Address Homelessness—The Budget includes an augmentation of $24.2 million in 2018-19 to help CalWORKs 

[13:1:76,559] families secure permanent housing, increasing total funding from $47 million to $95 million annually beginning in 2019-20; 

[13:2:76,569] increases the daily payment rate for temporary housing assistance from $65 to $85, effective January 1, 2019, with costs of 

[13:3:76,579] $8.1 million in 2018-19 and $15.3 million annually thereafter; and provides one-time funding of $15 million General Fund to 

[13:4:76,589] establish a three-year pilot program, with local matching funds, designed to provide housing-related supports to seniors 

[13:5:76,599] experiencing or at risk of homelessness. 

[14:0:65,616] •   IHSS Provider Paid Sick Leave—The Budget includes $29.3 million General Fund to reflect implementation of eight paid sick 

[14:1:76,626] leave hours for IHSS providers beginning on July 1, 2018. Accrued paid sick leave hours will increase to 16 hours and 24 

[14:2:76,636] hours annually when the state minimum hourly wage reaches $13 and $15, respectively. General Fund costs are projected 

[14:3:76,646] to grow to $131.2 million by 2022-23. 

[15:0:65,662] •   Immigration Services—The Budget includes a total of $65 million General Fund, including one-time funding of $17 million, for 

[15:1:76,673] the Immigration Services Program to provide a broad array of legal services and remedies for individuals and families related 

[15:2:76,683] to immigration status. The one-time funds will be used primarily to benefit unaccompanied undocumented minors and other 

[15:3:76,693] minors in removal proceedings, current and past beneficiaries of federal temporary protected status, and persons on 

[15:4:76,703] California State University campuses. The Budget also includes $10 million one-time Proposition 98 General Fund to provide 

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:2:76,85] provides $79 million General Fund for immigration services in 2018-19, and $48 million ongoing thereafter. 

[3:3:65,101] •   Foster Care Support—The Budget includes various increases to support foster youth and their caregivers, including: (1)

[3:5:76,122] resource family, (2) $16.8 million General Fund to eliminate the backlog of foster care resource family applications and 

[3:6:76,132] support the implementation of a tool to assess a child’s needed level of care, and (3) $4 million General Fund related to

[1:0:419,24] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:166,38] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[4:0:66,91] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 

[5:0:66,108] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support 

[5:1:66,119] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components: 

[6:0:65,136] •   California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) 

[7:0:65,152] •   Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food 

[7:1:76,163] Assistance Programs 

[8:0:65,179] •   Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program 

[9:0:65,195] •   County Administration and Automation Projects 

[10:0:65,211] •   Disaster Relief 

[11:0:66,229] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to 

[11:1:66,239] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor, 

[11:2:66,249] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 

[12:0:66,267] 4270010 - CalWORKs: 

[13:0:66,285] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is 

[13:1:66,295] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic 

[13:2:66,305] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes 

[13:3:66,315] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet 

[13:4:66,326] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs 

[13:5:66,336] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the 

[13:6:66,346] Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by the California Department of Education. Parents 

[13:7:66,356] have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs 

[13:8:66,366] families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and 

[13:9:66,377] development services. 

[14:0:66,394] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 

[15:0:66,412] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term 

[15:1:66,422] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as 

[15:2:66,432] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is 

[15:3:66,443] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social 

[15:4:66,453] Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to 

[15:5:66,463] relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system. 

[16:0:66,481] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate 

[16:1:66,491] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in 

[16:2:66,501] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and 

[16:3:66,511] state law. 

[17:0:66,529] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs: 

[18:0:65,547] •   The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States 

[18:1:76,557] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs. 

[19:0:65,575] •   The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and 

[19:1:76,585] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States 

[19:2:76,595] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the 

[19:3:76,605] minor. 

[20:0:65,623] •   The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human 

[20:1:76,633] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are 

[20:2:76,643] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under 

[20:3:76,653] CalWORKs). 

[21:0:66,671] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of 

[21:1:66,681] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of 

[21:2:66,692] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations 

[21:3:66,702] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits 

[21:4:66,712] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program. 

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:407,24] 2018-19 STATE BUDGET — HHS   185 

[2:0:166,38] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in 

[3:1:66,75] employment and training activities. 

[4:0:66,93] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution 

[4:1:66,103] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for 

[4:2:66,113] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with 

[4:3:66,123] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a 

[4:4:66,134] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses. 

[5:0:66,151] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious 

[5:1:66,161] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity 

[5:2:66,172] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services 

[5:3:66,182] on October 1, 2016. 

[6:0:66,200] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 

[7:0:66,217] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled 

[7:1:66,227] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a 

[7:2:66,238] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who 

[7:3:66,248] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 

[8:0:66,266] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 

[9:0:66,283] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who 

[9:1:66,293] administer public assistance programs. 

[10:0:66,311] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 

[11:0:66,329] 4270046 - Disaster Relief: 

[12:0:66,347] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have 

[12:1:66,357] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance 

[12:2:66,367] programs. 

[13:0:66,385] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 

[14:0:66,402] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child 

[14:1:66,413] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and 

[14:2:66,423] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of 

[14:3:66,433] the service delivery system. 

[15:0:66,451] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 

[16:0:66,468] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in 

[16:1:66,479] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who 

[16:2:66,489] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs 

[16:3:66,499] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option, 

[16:4:66,509] and IHSS-Residual Program. 

[17:0:66,527] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 

[18:0:66,545] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse 

[18:1:66,555] Prevention. 

[19:0:66,572] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and 

[19:1:66,583] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated 

[19:2:66,593] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with 

[19:3:66,603] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and 

[19:4:66,613] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from 

[19:5:66,623] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff. 

[20:0:66,641] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter 

[20:1:66,651] 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to change 

[20:2:66,662] out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment and case 

[20:3:66,672] planning. 

[21:0:66,689] The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and 

[21:1:66,700] private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for 

[21:2:66,710] children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services 

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:166,38] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents; 

[3:1:66,75] training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For 

[3:2:66,85] independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the 

[3:3:66,95] biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice. 

[3:4:66,113] The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and 

[3:5:66,123] sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and 

[3:6:66,134] services for at risk families and their children. 

[4:0:66,151] The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of physical and financial abuse and 

[4:1:66,161] neglect or exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 

[4:2:66,179] The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health 

[4:3:66,189] and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes 

[4:4:66,200] facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components. 

[4:5:66,217] 4275028 - Special Programs: 

[5:0:66,235] The Special Programs provides funds for Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, Access Assistance to the 

[5:1:66,245] Deaf, Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services and Legal Services for Unaccompanied and 

[5:2:66,255] Undocumented Minors. 

[5:3:66,273] 4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER 

[6:0:66,291] The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project provides 

[6:1:66,301] participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state foster care 

[6:2:66,311] maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable. 

[6:3:66,329] 4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 

[7:0:66,347] The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and 

[7:1:66,357] provide administrative services to other agencies. 

[7:2:66,374] 4285010 - Disability Evaluation: 

[8:0:66,392] The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents 

[8:1:66,402] applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of 

[8:2:66,413] the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and 

[8:3:66,423] overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 

[8:4:66,440] 4285019 - Services to Other Agencies: 

[9:0:66,458] In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative 

[9:1:66,468] services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human 

[9:2:66,479] Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public 

[9:3:66,489] information services. 

[9:4:66,506] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION 

[10:0:66,524] The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and

[6:0:66,157] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 

[6:1:66,167] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts 

[6:2:66,177] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified 

[6:3:66,187] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to 

[6:4:66,197] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision 

[6:5:66,208] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for 

[6:6:66,218] county health and social services programs.

[1:0:202,43] 5196   2011 State-Local Realignment 

[1:1:66,64] Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a 

[1:2:66,74] dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility. 

[1:3:66,92] Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services, 

[1:4:66,102] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is 

[1:5:66,112] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and 

[1:6:66,123] technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at 

[1:7:66,133] less cost. 

[1:8:66,150] The funding sources for realignment are: 

[1:9:65,168] •   The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax. 

[1:10:65,184] •   The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 

[2:0:66,202] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts: 

[2:1:65,220] •   Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services) 

[2:2:65,236] •   Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care; 

[2:3:76,246] Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment) 

[2:4:65,262] •   Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs) 

[2:5:65,279] •   Trial Court Security Subaccount 

[3:0:65,295] •   Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and 

[3:1:76,305] Adult Parole) 

[3:2:65,321] •   Community Corrections Subaccount 

[3:3:65,337] •   District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount 

[4:0:65,354] •   Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant 

[4:1:76,364] Special Account) 

[5:0:66,381] The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on 

[5:1:66,392] statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures. 

[6:0:66,409] Note the $4.9 billion in 2017-18 and $5.1 billion in 2018-19 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety 

[6:1:66,420] programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full
