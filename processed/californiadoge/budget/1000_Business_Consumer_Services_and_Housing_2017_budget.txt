[9:1:58,472] The Department of Consumer Affairs (Department) is responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of millions of 

[9:2:58,481] California consumers by serving as a guardian and advocate for their health, safety, and economic well-being and by 

[9:3:58,490] promoting legal and ethical standards of professional conduct. The Department helps to promote good business practices 

[9:4:58,499] and to ensure that California's consumers receive quality services by establishing minimal competency standards for 

[9:5:58,508] approximately 250 classifications involving approximately three million professionals. The Department is also an important 

[9:6:58,517] advocate on consumer and business issues. In general, the Department's Boards and Bureaus provide exams and 

[9:7:58,526] licensing, enforcement, complaint resolution, and education for consumers. 

[10:0:58,544] In addition, centralized services are provided by the Department for efficiency. Specifically, Department staff investigate 

[10:1:58,553] complaints against licensees; develop valid examinations for applicants for licensure; monitor and advocate for legislation; 

[10:2:58,562] provide consumer education and outreach; provide legal and audit services; and provide general administrative support 

[10:3:58,571] involving personnel, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, and space management. 

[11:0:58,589] Effective Fiscal Year 2016-17, the Department is no longer separated into two business units, and is now displayed under 

[11:1:58,598] one business unit, 1111. 

[12:0:58,616] There are currently 26 boards, two committees, and one commission under the broad authority of the Department, and nine 

[12:1:58,625] bureaus and one certification program under the direct oversight of the Department. 

[13:0:58,643] Additional information on the Department, and the various boards and bureaus, is available at www.dca.ca.gov.

[4:3:58,168] Housing Law, and the Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act of 1980. HCD works with factory and site-built building 

[4:4:58,177] industries, stakeholders, and other government agencies to review, amend, and recommend incorporation of model building 

[4:5:58,186] codes for conventional construction into California's building standards. The program also enforces federal and state 

[4:6:58,195] standards for the construction, safety, sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars.

[5:2:58,249] awarding state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and 

[5:3:58,258] (4) monitor funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state. The program also promotes 

[5:4:58,267] economic and job development through administration of the federal Community Development Block Grant Program, and is 

[5:5:58,276] responsible for the state Enterprise Zone Program wind-down. 

[5:6:58,294] 1670 - HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

[6:0:58,312] The objectives of this program are to: (1) facilitate an adequate supply of housing affordable to all income groups through

[6:3:58,339] collect and analyze data to evaluate and communicate progress in meeting HCD goals and outcomes. 

[6:4:58,357] 1675 - CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY 

[7:0:58,375] The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to finance housing at affordable interest rates using lending models that 

[7:1:58,384] facilitate: (1) mortgage loans to qualified low and moderate income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an affordable 

[7:2:58,393] home, (2) permanent loans to create and preserve multifamily housing projects, and (3) special needs housing loans to 

[7:3:58,402] facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing needed to serve special needs populations. CalHFA also 

[7:4:58,411] administers the California Housing Loan Insurance Fund activity, which encourages the preservation of existing housing and 

[7:5:58,420] improves new housing opportunities by offering mortgage insurance products to homebuyers who might not qualify for 

[7:6:58,429] traditional lending programs. 

[7:7:58,447] 1680 - LOAN REPAYMENTS PROGRAM 

[8:0:58,465] This program displays the estimated loan repayments made under HCD's Financial Assistance Program. 

[8:1:58,483] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM

[9:1:58,510] policies, (2) fiduciary oversight and fiscal management through its audit, accounting, and budget functions, (3) development, 

[9:2:58,519] review, and implementation of legislation related to HCD programs, (4) housing-specific legal expertise, and (5) support 

[9:3:58,528] services in the areas of personnel, information technology, business services, and contract management.
