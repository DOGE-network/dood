[1:0:227,43] 3900   Air Resources Board  

[2:0:66,64] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes  

[3:0:66,74] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in  

[3:1:66,84] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.  

[4:0:66,95] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans  

[4:1:66,105] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air  

[4:2:66,115] pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for  

[5:0:66,125] Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40  

[6:0:66,135] percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB  

[6:1:66,146] 32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's  

[6:2:66,156] most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air  

[7:0:66,166] pollution control distrcts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement  

[7:1:66,176] all of its programs.  

[8:0:66,197] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay  

[8:1:66,207] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[8:0:66,208] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[8:1:65,226] • Exide Cleanup—The Budget includes $59.6 million General Fund on a one-time basis to accelerate the cleanup of additional  

[8:2:76,236] properties within a 1.7-mile radius of the closed Exide battery recycling facility over the next two years and complete cleanup  

[8:3:76,246] activities already initiated where costs have exceeded estimates due to unforeseen cleanup-related activities. This funding  

[8:4:76,256] will allow the Department to cleanup approximately 700 additional high-risk properties with high concentrations of lead in soil  

[8:5:76,267] and the greatest potential for exposure. The state continues to pursue cost recovery from Exide to reimburse the state for  

[8:6:76,277] these costs.  

[9:0:65,293] • Base Funding to Maintain Operations—The Budget includes $27.5 million General Fund on a one-time basis to backfill the  

[9:1:76,303] Hazardous Waste Control Account and eliminates the annual $16.7 million Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund’s General Fund  

[9:2:76,313] Loan repayment. This funding and elimination of the General Fund loan repayment will prevent the Hazardous Waste  

[9:3:76,324] Control Account and Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund from experiencing deficits in the budget year and allow the  

[9:4:76,334] Department to maintain current service levels.

[5:0:66,140] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,159] 3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,179] The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund  

[7:1:66,189] program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,170 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups,  

[7:2:66,199] and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 470 sites where the cleanup process is complete.  

[7:3:66,210] Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 820 land-use restrictions in  

[7:4:66,220] place on properties throughout the state.  

[8:0:66,240] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other  

[8:1:66,250] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to  

[8:2:66,261] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties,  

[8:3:66,271] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military  

[8:4:66,281] installations.  

[9:0:66,301] The program oversees environmental assessments and the cleanup of proposed new or expanding school sites to prevent or  

[9:1:66,312] reduce exposing students and staff to hazardous substances. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous  

[9:2:66,322] Waste Site, a former hazardous waste disposal site and federal Superfund Site.  

[10:0:66,342] The program works closely with other state agencies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local agencies  

[10:1:66,352] throughout the state to establish and implement viable grant and loan programs to aid in the assessment and cleanup of  

[10:2:66,363] brownfields sites.  

[11:0:66,383] The program works with the California Emergency Management Agency and other state agencies to assure response  

[11:1:66,393] readiness for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous  

[11:2:66,403] waste spills and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.  

[12:0:66,421] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT  

[13:0:66,439] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of  

[13:1:66,449] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at  

[13:2:66,459] 119 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous  

[13:3:66,469] waste, and approximately 300 facilities/generators that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages  

[13:4:66,480] approximately $2.2 billion in financial assurance resources, and supports and oversees local agencies implementing the  

[13:5:66,490] hazardous waste elements of the Unified Program.  

[14:0:66,508] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[14:1:66,518] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste  

[14:2:66,528] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused  

[14:3:66,538] enforcement initiatives. The program also ensures compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste  

[14:4:66,548] and used oil.  

[15:0:66,566] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS  

[16:0:66,584] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program strives to get manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to  

[16:1:66,594] toxic chemicals. SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products and use pollution prevention best practices. The  

[16:2:66,604] program implements the SCP regulations. SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order  

[16:3:66,614] to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the  

[16:4:66,625] analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption  

[16:5:66,635] of "green chemistry" practices.  

[17:0:66,652] Pollution Prevention responsibilities are to promote compliance with legislative mandates regarding consumer product chemical  

[17:1:66,663] safety. The program supports adoption of focused business sector pollution prevention strategies; supports local green  

[17:2:66,673] business initiatives; and helps the regulated community comply with laws and regulations.  

[18:0:66,691] This program, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment,  

[18:1:66,701] also implements the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program. The Department's Environmental  

[18:2:66,711] Chemistry Laboratory (ECL) is charged with measuring both targeted and new chemicals in blood and urine. Ongoing activities  

[19:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,69] include measuring these chemicals in studies of vulnerable populations, including mothers and their newborns, older women,  

[3:1:66,79] firefighters, and families with childhood leukemia. Additionally, ECL is continuously developing new methods to identify and  

[3:2:66,89] measure chemicals of emerging concern, including newer flame retardants and other substitutes and alternatives for restricted/ 

[3:3:66,99] banned toxic chemicals. The SCP program will rely on biomonitoring results for implementation of its three-year Priority  

[3:4:66,109] Products Work Plan. Biomonitoring evidence has been identified in the Work Plan as a priority screening tool for identification  

[3:5:66,120] of product-chemical combinations warranting consideration of safer alternatives.  

[3:6:66,137] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY  

[4:0:66,155] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)  

[4:1:66,165] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the Department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified  

[4:2:66,175] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for  

[4:3:66,186] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response  

[4:4:66,196] plans and inventories; California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements  

[4:5:66,206] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.  

[5:0:66,224] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,244] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees the removal and remedial actions in the  

[6:1:66,254] communities surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program,  

[6:2:66,265] the Department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including residences, schools, daycare  

[6:3:66,275] centers, and parks within a 1.7 mile radius of the facility. The program will cleanup contaminated soil at those properties with  

[6:4:66,285] the highest levels and greatest potential for exposure.  

[6:5:66,303] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[7:0:66,320] The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management,  

[7:1:66,331] information management, and business services. The program also provides legal counsel, external communication, analytical  

[7:2:66,341] chemistry support, environmental justice and tribal affairs consultation, and public participation services.

[2:0:66,64] The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians   and the state's  

[3:0:66,74] environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office  

[4:0:66,84] performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as  

[4:1:66,95] other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with the scientific tools and information upon which to base risk  

[4:2:66,105] management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing health risks, including risks to children and other sensitive  

[4:3:66,115] subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, hazardous and  

[5:0:66,125] municipal waste facilities, fish and shellfish, and sediments in bay and estuarine waters. The Office also evaluates community  

[5:1:66,135] pollution burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities.
