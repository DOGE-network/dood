[2:0:99,32] 8120   Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,87] 6500 - STANDARDS  

[5:0:66,107] The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also  

[5:1:66,117] provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and  

[5:2:66,127] counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices.  

[6:0:66,146] The Standards Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures  

[6:1:66,156] and program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement  

[6:2:66,166] agencies. It also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a  

[6:3:66,175] clearinghouse of successful program information. Finally, it conducts peace officer feasibility studies.  

[6:4:66,193] 6505 - TRAINING  

[7:0:66,212] The Training Program increases the competency of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that meet  

[7:1:66,222] identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses and assisting law enforcement  

[7:2:66,232] agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission assesses  

[7:3:66,242] training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of topics  

[7:4:66,251] necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training needs of  

[7:5:66,261] law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Training Program also presents advanced  

[7:6:66,271] training for law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership  

[7:7:66,281] Institute, and for trainers through the Instructor Development Institute. Other specialty programs include the Institute of Criminal  

[7:8:66,290] Investigation.  

[8:0:66,310] Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are  

[8:1:66,320] enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards.  

[8:2:66,337] 6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING  

[9:0:66,357] The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs associated  

[9:1:66,366] with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses associated with  

[9:2:66,376] training presentations to enable line officers to receive in-service training in areas of critical need. To encourage and assist local  

[9:3:66,386] law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in the selection and training of law enforcement officers,  

[9:4:66,396] the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, approximately 346 cities, and numerous specialized districts  

[9:5:66,405] and local agencies which have agreed to meet the Commission's standards.  

[9:6:66,423] 6515 - POST ADMINISTRATION  

[10:0:66,442] The   objective of the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training is to be the leading organization in  

[10:1:66,452] establishing professional standards, assuring top-quality training, and providing effective services to develop and support  

[10:2:66,462] California law enforcement personnel. California POST consists of multiple bureaus to ensure uniform standards and  

[10:3:66,472] compliance are applied to over 600 law enforcement agencies and 40 basic training academies statewide: Basic Training;  

[10:4:66,481] Management Counseling and   Projects;   Strategic Communications and Research; Learning Technology Resources; Training  

[10:5:66,491] Program Services; Training Delivery and Compliance; Computer Services; and Administrative Services. An additional six  

[10:6:66,501] bureaus have been established to support implementation of the Peace Officer Standards Accountability Division. A final

[0:0:66,13] GENERAL GOVERNMENT   2023-24 STATE BUDGET — GG   15 

[1:0:183,69] 8420   State Compensation Insurance Fund  

[2:0:66,90] State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was originally  

[2:1:66,100] enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing body of a  

[2:2:66,109] private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of directors for  

[2:3:66,119] approval.  

[3:0:66,139] State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore  

[3:1:66,148] injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers located  

[3:2:66,158] in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on policies  

[3:3:66,168] written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, and the  

[3:4:66,178] state is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the California civil  

[3:5:66,188] service process and are actually employees of the state.  

[4:0:66,207] State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the state and  

[4:1:66,217] because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not  

[4:2:66,227] financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund.  

[5:0:66,246] Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation coverage  

[5:1:66,256] and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to private  

[5:2:66,266] employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers'

[11:1:66,490] The California Department of Food and Agriculture serves the citizens of California by promoting and protecting a safe, healthy  

[11:2:66,500] food supply; and enhancing local and global agricultural trade, through efficient management, innovation, and sound science,  

[11:3:66,510] with a commitment to environmental stewardship.  

[12:0:66,529] The goals of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are to:  

[12:1:65,547] • Promote and protect the diverse local and global marketability of the California agricultural brand, which represents superior  

[12:2:76,557] quality, value, and safety.  

[13:0:65,572] • Optimize fiscal resources through collaboration, innovation, and process improvements.  

[14:0:65,588] • Connect rural and urban communities by supporting and participating in educational programs that emphasize a mutual  

[14:1:76,598] appreciation of the value of diverse food and agricultural production systems.  

[14:2:65,614] • Improve regulatory efficiency through proactive coordination with stakeholders.  

[14:3:65,629] • Invest in employee development and succession planning efforts.  

[15:0:66,647] Because the California Department of Food and Agriculture's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the  

[15:1:66,656] Department has a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see

[9:0:66,425] 6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES  

[10:0:66,445] The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and diseases to  

[10:1:66,454] California, promote judicious antimicrobial use and stewardship   and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat  

[10:2:66,464] products that are exempt from federal inspection. In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be  

[10:3:66,474] transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses,  

[10:4:66,484] (3) have severe negative impacts on the environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the  

[10:5:66,493] consumer.  

[11:0:66,511] 6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES  

[12:0:66,530] California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The  

[12:1:66,540] objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural  

[12:2:66,550] commodities, promote consumer protection, increase food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported  

[12:3:66,560] grading services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the  

[12:4:66,569] marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products.  

[12:5:66,587] Additionally, this program provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the  

[12:6:66,596] environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants.  

[12:7:66,614] 6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES  

[13:0:66,633] This program provides fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs.  

[14:0:66,653] The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California  

[14:1:66,662] State Fair (an independent state agency). State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and  

[14:2:66,672] periodic financial reviews and audits.  

[14:3:66,690] 6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES  

[15:0:66,709] This program provides fiscal and policy oversight   for federal grants that promote California agriculture, and for   CDFA  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[9:0:66,507] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:66,526] 6680 - REGULATION OF UTILITIES  

[11:0:66,544] Californians spend more than $50 billion annually for services from industries regulated by the PUC. This includes 6 electricity  

[11:1:66,553] utilities, 1,012 telecommunications carriers, 120 water and sewer utilities, 5 natural gas utilities with approximately 10.8 million  

[11:2:66,563] customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home park and propane operators.  

[12:0:66,580] The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions  

[12:1:66,590] include both backward-looking investigations and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk  

[12:2:66,600] analytics to mitigate emerging threats and identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC performs operation and  

[12:3:66,610] maintenance audits, outage inspections, mitigation reviews, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities and  

[12:4:66,619] coordinates closely with state public safety agencies to further resilience initiatives. The PUC’s safety oversight includes  

[12:5:66,629] enforcing public utility wildfire safety and Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) violations. It functions as the lead investigator  

[12:6:66,639] for utility incidents relating to wildfire events and recommends policy to strengthen PSPS guidelines. In addition to the PUC  

[12:7:66,649] opening formal investigations, the PUC imposes fines for natural gas, electric infrastructure, and wildfire safety-related  

[12:8:66,659] violations.  

[13:0:66,676] The PUC conducts reviews of utility operations every four years to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services.  

[13:1:66,686] The PUC provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities—and to a lesser extent, as directed by statute, an increasing number  

[13:2:66,695] of Community Choice Aggregators, Energy Service Providers, and Core Transport Agents—to follow when purchasing  

[13:3:66,705] electricity and natural gas on behalf of their customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and  

[13:4:66,715] where needed in the state.

[2:0:173,32] 8660   Public Utilities Commission - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation. The PUC is charged with  

[3:1:66,78] implementing and overseeing key components of Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015 (SB 350); Chapter 312, Statutes of 2018 (SB  

[3:2:66,88] 100); and other climate change legislation, including promoting ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, Integrated  

[3:3:66,98] Resource Planning, the state's mandated renewable energy programs, programs for disadvantaged communities, electric  

[3:4:66,108] vehicle programs, and other clean energy programs.  

[4:0:66,125] The PUC oversees programs and regulations to promote both natural gas and electricity reliability and resilience.  

[5:0:66,142] The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate  

[5:1:66,152] discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost  

[5:2:66,162] weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria.  

[6:0:66,179] The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for transmission,  

[6:1:66,189] telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects.  

[7:0:66,206] The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including  

[7:1:66,216] monitoring competitive markets for proper operation, enforcing carrier service standards for telecommunication services,  

[7:2:66,226] regulating rural telecommunication rates, protecting consumers against carrier abuses and fraud by applying licensing  

[7:3:66,235] requirements and rules for offering and terminating telecommunication services, and managing efficient deployment of area  

[7:4:66,245] codes and telephone numbers.  

[8:0:66,262] The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to  

[8:1:66,272] their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality,  

[8:2:66,282] promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change requests,  

[8:3:66,292] and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements.  

[9:0:66,309] The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in  

[9:1:66,319] participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in  

[9:2:66,329] proceedings.  

[10:0:66,346] The Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB) responds to questions regarding utility service and bills and assists consumers who have  

[10:1:66,356] unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. CAB also provides data on the consumer protection  

[10:2:66,365] issues it handles to stakeholders and decision makers to inform policy making. A Supplier Diversity program promotes and  

[10:3:66,375] monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse.  

[11:0:66,392] 6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS 

[12:0:66,410] The PUC oversees telecommunication-based universal service programs (Universal Lifeline Telephone Service Trust Fund,  

[12:1:66,419] California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, California Advanced Services Fund, and two  

[12:2:66,429] California High Cost Funds), all of which provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these  

[12:3:66,439] "universal service" programs include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) improving access  

[12:4:66,449] to broadband technology to bridge the digital divide; and (3) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make  

[12:5:66,459] informed choices about basic service and universal lifeline telephone services.  

[13:0:66,478] The California LifeLine Program provides discounted basic residential wireless and wireline telephone service to qualified low-

[13:1:66,488] income households. The California Teleconnect Fund Program provides discounted telecommunication services to qualifying  

[13:2:66,497] schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program  

[13:3:66,507] primarily provides equipment and telephone access services to people with hearing and other disabilities. The California  

[13:4:66,517] Advanced Services Fund Program mainly encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and  

[13:5:66,527] underserved rural and urban areas of California. The California High Cost Fund Programs provide subsidies to carriers  

[13:6:66,537] obligated to provide telephone service to customers residing in rural and high-cost areas.  

[14:0:66,556] 6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 

[15:0:66,573] The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in  

[15:1:66,583] California. All railroads, seven major rail transit agencies, six smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private  

[15:2:66,593] crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-

[15:3:66,603] certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and  

[15:4:66,612] appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of  

[15:5:66,622] hazardous materials by rail.  

[16:0:66,641] For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train control,  

[16:1:66,651] and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or  

[16:2:66,661] disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, as well as crossing safety treatments deployed at each  

[16:3:66,671] crossing. Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing  

[16:4:66,681] hazard elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-

[16:5:66,690] separating highway/rail crossings.

[3:0:66,68] The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation  

[3:1:66,78] companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, transportation network companies, and charter and scheduled bus operators) and  

[3:2:66,88] privately-owned water ferries. The program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety  

[3:3:66,98] standards and insurance requirements, and protects consumers from for-hire passenger carriers operating illegally.  

[4:0:66,117] 6695 - PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE  

[5:0:66,134] The mandate and function of the Public Advocate's Office is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The Public  

[5:1:66,144] Advocate's Office is charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility customers and subscribers in all  

[5:2:66,154] significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction.  

[6:0:66,171] Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the Public Advocate's Office with a director appointed by and serving at the  

[6:1:66,181] pleasure of the Governor and charged the Public Advocate's Office with representing ratepayer interests in PUC proceedings.  

[6:2:66,191] Chapter 1005, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement  

[6:3:66,201] Account to be transferred in the annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account. The law  

[6:4:66,210] further required that "funds in the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account shall be utilized exclusively by  

[6:5:66,220] the division in the performance of its duties as determined by the director" of the Public Advocates Office.  

[6:6:66,237] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that the Public Advocate's Office only represent ratepayers in  

[6:7:66,247] PUC proceedings. SB 201 extended the Public Advocate's Office representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the  

[6:8:66,257] Energy Commission, Air Resources Board, California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.

[10:0:66,458] The California Law Revision Commission (Commission) has the responsibility to make a continuing substantive review of  

[10:1:66,467] California statutory and decisional law, to recommend legislation to make needed reforms, and to make recommendations to  

[10:2:66,477] the Governor and Legislature for revision of the law on major topics (as assigned by the Legislature) that require detailed study  

[10:3:66,487] and cannot easily be handled in the ordinary legislative process.  

[11:0:66,506] The Commission consists of seven gubernatorial appointees plus one Senator, one Assembly Member, and the Legislative  

[11:1:66,516] Counsel. The Commission's work is independent, nonpartisan, and objective.  

[12:0:66,533] The Commission also administers and provides staff support for the Committee on Revision of the Penal Code. The Committee  

[12:1:66,543] is responsible for studying the Penal Code and   recommending reforms to simplify and rationalize California’s criminal law and  

[12:2:66,553] procedures.   The Committee consists of five gubernatorial appointees, one Senator, and one Assembly Member.

[8:0:197,299] 8855   California State Auditor's Office  

[9:0:66,320] The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public funds  

[9:1:66,330] and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of state and  

[9:2:66,339] local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State  

[9:3:66,349] Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity.  

[9:4:66,359] The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by  

[9:5:66,369] the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually  

[9:6:66,378] conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements  

[9:7:66,388] and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a  

[9:8:66,398] condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that  

[9:9:66,408] requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter  

[9:10:66,418] biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which  

[9:11:66,427] includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.  

[10:0:66,447] The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse,  

[10:1:66,457] and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority  

[10:2:66,466] to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter  

[10:3:66,476] 451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local  

[10:4:66,486] government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the  

[10:5:66,496] potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or  

[10:6:66,506] effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities.  

[11:0:66,525] Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform  

[12:0:66,535] independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The  

[12:1:66,545] State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper  

[12:2:66,554] acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law.  

[13:0:66,574] The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an  

[13:1:66,584] application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10  

[13:2:66,593] years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and  

[13:3:66,603] conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

[8:5:66,351] programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources,  

[8:6:66,361] and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Federal Funds

[8:8:66,380] for federal stimulus and disaster recovery funds, while also performing certain federal disaster cost recovery activities in  

[8:9:66,390] coordination with the California Office of Emergency Services. Basic and applied economic and tax research functions support

[8:0:66,365] The Department of FISCal operates the statewide financial system to enable California to perform budgeting, accounting,  

[8:1:66,375] procurement and cash management functions transparently and efficiently. The Department of FISCal is responsible for  

[8:2:66,384] supporting the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal), including supporting the system's customers and  

[8:3:66,394] stakeholders.

[9:1:66,424] Finance, the State Controller's Office, the State Treasurer's Office, and the Department of General Services) maintain a  

[9:2:66,433] partnership with the Department of FISCal. FI$Cal provides the state with a single integrated financial management system that  

[9:3:66,443] encompasses budgeting, accounting, procurement, cash management, and financial management and reporting. FI$Cal,  

[9:4:66,453] through the adoption of best business practices, reengineers business processes; improves efficiency; enhances decision  

[9:5:66,463] making and resource management; and provides reliable, accessible, and timely statewide financial information allowing the  

[9:6:66,472] state to be more transparent. FI$Cal further enables transparency through its Open FI$Cal website, which was implemented in  

[9:7:66,482] 2018 pursuant to Government Code section 11862. The website continues to expand providing the public with access to a

[7:0:66,257] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:0:66,276] 6911 - NATIONAL GUARD  

[9:0:66,295] The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our  

[9:1:66,305] State Guard. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications, law  

[10:0:66,315] enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and unmanned  

[10:1:66,325] aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant General  

[11:0:66,334] element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal resource  

[11:1:66,344] management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil Support  

[11:2:66,354] element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and unity of  

[11:3:66,364] purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the deployment of  

[11:4:66,374] Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the Governor due to  

[11:5:66,383] domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with the coordination  

[11:6:66,393] necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Guard is a volunteer component of the Military Department whose  

[11:7:66,403] mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for mobilization, demobilization, and  

[11:8:66,413] provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal government provides virtually all  

[12:0:66,422] supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training, deployment, and commitment of  

[12:1:66,432] the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and Air Force Regulations and  

[12:2:66,442] Training Guidance.  

[13:0:66,459] 6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS  

[14:0:66,477] The Military Department manages and maintains partnerships with the following twelve programs while serving more than  

[14:1:66,486] 13,000 youth annually: California Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, Porterville Military  

[14:2:66,496] Academy, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, California Job ChalleNGe,  

[14:3:66,506] STARBASE Academy Sacramento, STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos, STARBASE Academy Porterville, and STARBASE  

[14:4:66,516] Academy San Luis Obispo. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by the California Legislature and then- Adjutant  

[14:5:66,525] General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is designed to provide maximum growth and  

[14:6:66,535] leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It provides leadership opportunities for cadets  

[14:7:66,545] by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their cadet military units, and by demonstrating  

[14:8:66,555] proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of their training, cadets aid and support to the  

[14:9:66,564] school and community. The Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, and Porterville Military Academy develops  

[14:10:66,574] leaders of character by providing rigorous programs to promote excellence in academics, leadership, citizenship, athletics, and  

[14:11:66,584] physical fitness/wellbeing. Additionally, the programs instill the 10 Cadet Corps values of loyalty, education, ambition, duty,  

[14:12:66,594] enthusiasm, respect, service, health, integrity, and personal courage. Using a military framework, these programs graduate  

[14:13:66,604] cadets who can meet the admissions requirements for college and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The  

[14:14:66,613] mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 15½-18 year old high school  

[14:15:66,623] dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as  

[15:0:66,633] productive citizens. California Job ChalleNGe located at Los Alamitos, CA is a continuation program to provide vocational skills  

[15:1:66,643] to California ChalleNGe graduates. The overall mission provides post-secondary Career Technical Education (CTE) training to  

[15:2:66,652] place graduates into viable jobs. The goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school  

[15:3:66,662] students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their  

[16:0:66,672] education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of  

[16:1:66,682] the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities  

[16:2:66,692] more attractive and accessible. While attending STARBASE students interact with military personnel to explore careers and  

[16:3:66,701] observe STEM applications in the "real world." These twelve youth programs are financed with federal, state and local funds.  

[16:4:66,711] The California National Guard is involved in youth programs because political and community leaders at the federal, state, and

[8:0:199,427] 8955   Department of Veterans Affairs  

[9:0:66,448] The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring  

[9:1:66,458] our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. CalVet promotes and delivers  

[9:2:66,468] innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners.  

[10:0:66,487] More specifically, CalVet:  

[10:1:65,504] • Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to  

[10:2:76,514] educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits.  

[10:3:65,530] • Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits  

[10:4:76,540] before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals.  

[10:5:65,555] • Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans  

[10:6:76,565] to acquire farms and homes.  

[11:0:65,581] • Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a  

[11:1:76,591] home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes.  

[11:2:66,608] This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public  

[11:3:66,618] purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment  

[11:4:66,628] assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to  

[11:5:66,637] military service.  

[12:0:66,657] Because CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support  

[12:1:66,667] this need.   For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[10:1:66,483] 7500 - HOMEOWNERS' PROPERTY TAX RELIEF  

[11:0:66,503] In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying  

[11:1:66,512] property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the state  

[11:2:66,522] to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption.   This Program also receives repayments  

[11:3:66,532] from persons participating in the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Program, whereby the  

[11:4:66,542] state makes property tax payments for qualified homeowners in exchange for the participants making repayment when they  

[11:5:66,551] relinquish ownership.  

[11:6:66,569] 7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE  

[12:0:66,588] The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural,  

[12:1:66,598] scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to be  

[12:2:66,608] assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties to  

[12:3:66,618] partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program.

[11:0:66,498] The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash flow  

[11:1:66,508] and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow imbalances  

[11:2:66,518] during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the General Fund may  

[11:3:66,528] need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. Budgetary loans may be used to loan monies from various state funds to  

[11:4:66,538] the General Fund to help bridge a budget shortfall. These loans are temporary, and do not harm the operations of departmental  

[11:5:66,547] programs.

[11:0:66,327] 7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,346] Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities  

[13:0:66,366] Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to as  

[13:1:66,375] "borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in slightly  

[13:2:66,385] modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables the  

[13:3:66,395] General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these funds'  

[13:4:66,405] money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not interfere  

[13:5:66,415] with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a fund is  

[13:6:66,424] designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State Controller's  

[13:7:66,434] Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund cash  

[13:8:66,444] shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire cash  

[13:9:66,454] balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes.  

[14:0:66,473] A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79,  

[14:1:66,483] Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state entity  

[14:2:66,493] that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 million  

[14:3:66,503] and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in this  

[14:4:66,512] Program.  

[15:0:66,532] A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, Government  

[15:1:66,542] Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity for  

[15:2:66,551] the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the maximum amount for the VIP  

[15:3:66,561] from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this Program.  

[16:0:66,590] Borrowing From Financial Markets  

[17:0:66,610] In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this doctrine,  

[17:1:66,620] an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 1 of Article  

[17:2:66,630] XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This doctrine was  

[17:3:66,639] invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and again in 1971 to  

[17:4:66,649] validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions were invoked in  

[17:5:66,659] 1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like registered warrants,  

[17:6:66,669] required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes provisions were re-

[17:7:66,678] enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84.  

[18:0:66,698] In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided the  

[18:1:66,708] flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external funds  

[19:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:136,32] 9620   Cash Management and Budgetary Loans - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which the  

[3:1:66,78] General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code.  

[4:0:66,98] External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation warrants  

[4:1:66,108] (RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in anticipation of  

[4:2:66,117] receiving revenues in the near future.  

[5:0:66,137] Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any  

[5:1:66,147] other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow.  

[6:0:66,176] Overall Program  

[7:0:66,196] Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for the  

[7:1:66,205] past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts nor  

[7:2:66,215] disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. To reflect cash flow, budget data is  

[7:3:66,225] converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the Controller and for  

[7:4:66,235] accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and administrative actions.  

[8:0:66,254] The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and  

[8:1:66,264] assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used  

[8:2:66,274] from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year.  

[8:3:66,291] 7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS  

[9:0:66,308] The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are repaid over  

[9:1:66,318] multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are repaid with interest calculated at the Pooled Money  

[9:2:66,328] Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

[11:0:157,424] 9625   Interest Payments to the Federal Government  

[12:0:66,445] Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal  

[12:1:66,455] government. The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds between  

[12:2:66,465] the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely fund  

[12:3:66,474] disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds in the  

[12:4:66,484] state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal government  

[12:5:66,494] from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state account; and (d) the  

[12:6:66,504] federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the state account until the  

[12:7:66,514] funds are paid out for program purposes.  

[13:0:66,533] The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $422 million or more in federal fund  

[13:1:66,543] expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e.,  

[13:2:66,553] check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be  

[13:3:66,562] deposited before the warrants are issued.  

[14:0:66,582] Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest  

[14:1:66,592] liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

[1:0:168,69] 9650   Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants  

[2:0:66,90] This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents.  

[3:0:66,109] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan.  

[3:1:66,119] Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was added  

[3:2:66,129] in 1982.  

[4:0:66,148] The 2022-23 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016,  

[4:1:66,158] maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested  

[4:2:66,168] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment  

[4:3:66,178] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90  

[4:4:66,188] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer  

[4:5:66,197] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.  

[5:0:66,217] The 2022-23 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and after January 1, 2017,  

[5:1:66,227] maintains the average 80/80 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871.3 for fully vested  

[5:2:66,236] members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment  

[5:3:66,246] in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 80  

[5:4:66,256] percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer  

[5:5:66,266] contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.  

[6:0:66,285] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined  

[6:1:66,295] on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2022 monthly contribution  

[6:2:66,305] maximums are $816 for a single enrollee, $1,548 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,983 for an enrollee and two or  

[6:3:66,315] more dependents. The 2023 monthly contribution maximums are $883 for a single enrollee, $1,699 for an enrollee and one  

[6:4:66,324] dependent, and $2,124 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan and number of  

[6:5:66,334] dependents.  

[7:0:66,354] Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code  

[7:1:66,363] 6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

[6:0:204,212] 9658   Budget Stabilization Account  

[7:0:66,233] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization  

[7:1:66,243] Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. Proposition 2 strengthened  

[7:2:66,252] the reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the  

[7:3:66,262] BSA, and increasing the reserve limit.  

[8:0:66,282] Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers  

[8:1:66,291] between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a calculated  

[8:2:66,301] amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities.  

[9:0:66,328] LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY  

[9:1:66,346] PROGRAM AUTHORITY  

[10:0:66,366] Section 20 and Section 22, Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California.

[10:2:66,393] Item 9658-011-0001, 2016 Budget Act and 2018 Budget Act.  

[11:0:66,429] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[12:0:66,448] 7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy day"  

[12:1:66,458] 50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital gains over 8  

[12:2:66,468] percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 percent to pay  

[12:3:66,477] down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy day," reduced by  

[12:4:66,487] any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance in the BSA is limited to  

[12:5:66,497] 10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes for the fiscal year. Any amounts in excess of ten percent may only be used for  

[12:6:66,507] infrastructure needs.  

[13:0:66,526] Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years.  

[14:0:66,546] The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds  

[14:1:66,556] from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for  

[14:2:66,565] appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year.  

[15:0:66,585] Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will  

[15:1:66,595] smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum  

[15:2:66,604] guarantee calculation.   See 9889 - Public School System Stabilization Account for more information on the Proposition 98  

[15:3:66,614] reserve.

[5:1:66,183] 7765 - EQUITY CLAIMS  

[6:0:66,203] This program includes all claims approved by the three-member California Victim Compensation Board and the Government  

[6:1:66,212] Claims Program under the Department of General Services, and referred to the Legislature in the omnibus claims bills for  

[6:2:66,222] payment. The program provides an equitable procedure for the payment of the following categories of claims:  

[6:3:65,239] • Claims for which no appropriation has been made or for which no fund is available, but the settlement of which has been  

[6:4:76,249] provided for by statute or constitutional provision.  

[6:5:65,265] • Claims for which the appropriation made or fund designated is exhausted.  

[6:6:65,281] • Claims for which settlement is not otherwise provided for by statute or constitutional provision.  

[6:7:66,298] The Government Claims Program was transferred to the Department of General Services from the former California Victim  

[6:8:66,308] Compensation and Government Claims Board in July 2016. The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims  

[6:9:66,318] Board became the California Victim Compensation Board.  

[6:10:66,335] 7770 - SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS  

[7:0:66,354] This program includes claims paid through judgment and settlement bills sponsored by the Department of Justice each year.  

[7:1:66,364] The claims are either judgments against the state or settlements approved by the Department of Justice pursuant to the  

[7:2:66,374] authority provided in Government Code Section 948 et seq.

[12:0:164,553] 9800   Augmentation for Employee Compensation  

[13:0:66,574] This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated money,  

[13:1:66,584] through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the funding for  

[13:2:66,594] those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet appropriated by the  

[13:3:66,603] Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item.  

[14:0:66,623] Additionally, this item sets aside funding for penalties the state may face under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Beginning in  

[14:1:66,633] 2015, the state became subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provision of the ACA. This provision requires large  

[14:2:66,642] employers to offer health benefits to full-time employees, defined as those who work on average 130 or more hours per month  

[14:3:66,652] (or 30 hours per week), and their dependent children. Under this provision, the state may be subject to penalties (Part B  

[15:0:66,662] Penalty), which may include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that may have been considered full-time for one or  

[15:1:66,672] more months, were not offered or did not qualify for health benefits through the state, purchased health coverage from the  

[15:2:66,682] Health Insurance Marketplace (known as Covered California), and received a premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction.  

[16:0:66,701] The ACA also contains reporting requirements, which require the state to track specified ACA-related employee information on  

[16:1:66,711] a monthly basis to identify the employees who meet health eligibility requirements, document whether benefits were offered,  

[17:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:168,69] 9885   Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances  

[2:0:66,90] For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not yet  

[2:1:66,100] been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure totals.  

[2:2:66,109] This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department budgets.  

[3:0:66,129] For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that  

[4:0:66,139] encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore,  

[4:1:66,148] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General  

[4:2:66,158] Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and state  

[4:3:66,168] policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide adjustment  

[4:4:66,178] to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government Code Section  

[4:5:66,188] 13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary Schedule 1 for the  

[4:6:66,197] General Fund.  

[5:0:66,217] COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT  

[6:0:66,236] The State Controller's Office accumulated a General Fund encumbrance total of $5,272,100,000 from 2020-21 year-end  

[6:1:66,246] financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are estimated to be at the same  

[6:2:66,256] level for the following fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within the next fiscal year.   Upon completion of the  

[6:3:66,266] year-end financial reports by the State Controller's Office, the budget information will be updated in the spring.   The  

[6:4:66,275] Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the encumbrance adjustment.

[1:0:162,65] 9889   Public School System Stabilization Account  

[2:0:66,86] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, established the Public School System Stabilization Account (PSSSA) as  

[2:1:66,96] a ”rainy day“ reserve for K-14 schools.  

[3:0:66,113] Proposition 2 requires Proposition 98 General Fund deposits into or withdrawals from the fund each year, as well as two  

[3:1:66,123] preceding fiscal years, when specific criteria are met.   Calculation of a deposit or withdrawal from the   PSSSA does not change  

[3:2:66,133] the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee calculation.

[3:0:122,88] 9900   Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata)  

[4:0:66,109] Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide  

[5:0:66,118] budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments. The Pro Rata process apportions  

[5:1:66,128] the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit from the  

[6:0:66,138] services. Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are transferred from  

[6:1:66,148] the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund.  

[7:0:66,167] Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata assessments to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets. This  

[7:1:66,177] budget item included Pro Rata transfers directly assessed to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not  

[7:2:66,187] provided for in departmental budgets. Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata transfers assessed directly at the  

[7:3:66,197] fund level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
