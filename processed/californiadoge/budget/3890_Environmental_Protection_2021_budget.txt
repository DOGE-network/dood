[1:0:227,39] 3900   Air Resources Board  

[2:0:66,61] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes  

[3:0:66,71] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in  

[3:1:66,81] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.  

[4:0:66,91] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans  

[4:1:66,101] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air  

[4:2:66,112] pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for  

[5:0:66,122] Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40  

[6:0:66,132] percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB  

[6:1:66,142] 32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's  

[6:2:66,152] most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air  

[7:0:66,163] pollution control districts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement  

[7:1:66,173] its programs.  

[8:0:66,193] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay  

[8:1:66,203] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[1:0:418,13] 2021-22 STATE BUDGET — EP   53 

[2:0:136,32] 3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued 

[3:0:66,88] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[4:0:65,107] • Risk-Based Contaminated Site Cleanup—In conjunction with governance and fiscal reform and to support community  

[4:1:76,118] development and job creation, the Budget includes $500 million one-time General Fund over three years to accelerate the  

[4:2:76,128] cleanup of contaminated properties in impacted communities. This investment will be allocated for clean-up and investigation  

[4:3:76,138] work at sites across the state according to health-based criteria.  

[5:0:65,154] • Exide Residential Cleanup—The Budget includes $322.4 million General Fund over three years as a loan to clean up  

[5:1:76,164] residential properties with specified contamination levels that surround the Exide facility. 

[5:2:65,181] • Exide: Ongoing Closure and Environmental Actions at the Vernon Facility—The Budget includes $132 million General Fund  

[5:3:76,191] one-time as a loan to the Toxic Substances Control Account to complete closure activities and to conduct additional needed  

[5:4:76,201] cleanup at the former Exide Technologies, Inc. facility in Vernon, California.  

[5:5:65,217] • Exide Cost Recovery—The Budget includes $14 million one-time General Fund for the Department to pay the Attorney  

[5:6:76,227] General and outside legal counsel to recover costs from potentially responsible parties for contamination in communities  

[5:7:76,238] surrounding the Exide facility. The Budget also includes $2.5 million ongoing from the Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund and 6  

[5:8:76,248] positions for these cost recovery efforts and future lead-acid battery facility related cost recovery efforts.

[12:0:66,539] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[13:0:66,558] 3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM  

[14:0:66,576] The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund  

[14:1:66,586] program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,259 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups,  

[14:2:66,596] and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 238 sites where the cleanup process is complete.  

[14:3:66,607] Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,066 land-use restrictions in  

[14:4:66,617] place on properties throughout the state.  

[15:0:66,635] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other  

[15:1:66,645] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to  

[15:2:66,655] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties,  

[15:3:66,665] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military  

[15:4:66,675] installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former  

[15:5:66,686] hazardous waste disposal site.

[1:0:418,13] 2021-22 STATE BUDGET — EP   55 

[2:0:136,32] 3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness  

[3:1:66,79] for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills  

[3:2:66,89] and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.  

[4:0:66,107] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT  

[5:0:66,124] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of  

[5:1:66,135] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at  

[5:2:66,145] 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous  

[5:3:66,155] waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300  

[5:4:66,165] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[5:5:66,175] assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of  

[5:6:66,186] the Unified Program.  

[6:0:66,203] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[6:1:66,214] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste  

[6:2:66,224] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused  

[6:3:66,234] enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste  

[6:4:66,244] and used oil.  

[7:0:66,262] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS  

[8:0:66,280] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic  

[8:1:66,290] chemicals. The SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by eliminating or reducing their use of hazardous  

[8:2:66,300] chemicals which may harm people or the environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in  

[8:3:66,310] products in order to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product  

[8:4:66,320] manufacturers for the analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program  

[8:5:66,331] encourages the adoption of "green chemistry" practices.  

[9:0:66,348] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY  

[10:0:66,366] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)  

[10:1:66,376] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified  

[10:2:66,386] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for  

[10:3:66,397] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response  

[10:4:66,407] plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements  

[10:5:66,417] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.  

[11:0:66,435] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM  

[12:0:66,452] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities  

[12:1:66,463] surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program, the  

[12:2:66,473] department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including residences, schools, daycare  

[12:3:66,483] centers, and parks within a 1.7-mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated soil at those properties with  

[12:4:66,493] the highest levels of lead in soil and greatest potential for exposure.  

[13:0:66,511] 3650 - BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY  

[14:0:66,529] The Board of Environmental Safety is a five-member board that will set fees through regulations, hear hazardous waste permit  

[14:1:66,539] appeals, and provide strategic guidance to the department. The board also contains an Ombudsperson who will serve as a  

[14:2:66,549] resource to the public and the regulated community.  

[15:0:66,567] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION

[3:0:66,69] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,88] 3700 - Waste Reduction and Management  

[3:2:66,109] The objectives of the Waste Reduction and Management Program include:  

[3:3:65,126] • Overseeing that all nonhazardous solid waste is stored, collected, processed, and disposed in a safe and environmentally  

[3:4:76,136] sound manner.  

[4:0:65,153] • Participating in the development and maintenance of local solid waste management plans that describe how each city and  

[4:1:76,163] county will reduce solid waste disposal to achieve at minimum a 50 percent diversion of waste from landfills.  

[4:2:65,179] • Developing programs and policies to support the state goal that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source  

[4:3:76,189] reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020 and after.  

[4:4:65,205] • Reducing organic waste disposal 75 percent   by 2025 to support the state’s climate goals and rescue at least 20 percent   of  

[4:5:76,216] currently disposed surplus food by 2025.  

[5:0:65,232] • Cleaning up solid waste disposal sites when the responsible party either cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to pay  

[5:1:76,242] for timely remediation, and where cleanup is needed to protect public health and safety, or the environment.  

[5:2:65,258] • Developing and promoting waste reduction strategies through reuse, upcycling, and source reduction.  

[5:3:65,274] • Promoting the use of recycled materials in California manufacturing.  

[5:4:65,291] • Reducing the number of tires placed in landfills, illegally dumped, or stockpiled while promoting technologies turning waste  

[5:5:76,301] tires into useful products.  

[5:6:65,317] • Reducing the amount of improperly disposed used oil and promoting used oil recycling.  

[5:7:65,333] • Reducing electronic waste by providing safe and convenient collection and recycling of specified electronic equipment.  

[5:8:65,349] • Responding to local recovery needs following natural disasters by coordinating debris removal operations in collaboration  

[5:9:76,360] with federal, state, and local agency partners.

[8:0:66,344] The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians   and the state's  

[9:0:66,354] environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support, and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office  

[9:1:66,364] performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as  

[9:2:66,375] other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with scientific tools and information upon which to base risk-

[10:0:66,385] management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing hazards and   health risks, including risks to children and other  

[10:1:66,395] sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, and fish and  

[10:2:66,405] shellfish, as well as health and environmental impacts from climate change. The Office also evaluates community pollution  

[10:3:66,415] burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities and reduce exposures and  

[10:4:66,426] risks to residents.
