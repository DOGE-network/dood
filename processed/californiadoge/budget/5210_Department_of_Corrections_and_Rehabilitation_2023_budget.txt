[12:4:66,359] operations for three facilities and one conservation camp.  

[13:0:66,376] Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post  

[13:1:66,386] release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based  

[13:2:66,396] treatment programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption  

[13:3:66,405] therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp  

[13:4:66,415] programs, and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior

[16:0:66,487] The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the  

[16:1:66,496] California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and  

[16:2:66,506] knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release.  

[17:0:66,523] The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and  

[17:1:66,533] Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development

[3:0:66,68] 4530 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - GENERAL SECURITY  

[4:0:66,86] CDCR is required by statute to accept convicted felons from California courts when their sentence is imprisonment in a state  

[4:1:66,96] correctional facility. The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - General Security program is to  

[4:2:66,105] provide safe and secure detention facilities to protect public safety. This program consists of 33 correctional institutions, three  

[4:3:66,115] of which have reception centers, one leased facility, and 34 conservation camps.   This program also identifies custody overtime  

[4:4:66,125] expenditures associated with housing, guarding, and transporting incarcerated people.  

[5:0:66,142] 4540 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INMATE SUPPORT  

[6:0:66,159] The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Inmate Support program is to provide necessary services  

[6:1:66,169] to incarcerated people such as feeding, clothing, record keeping, and classification assessments at 33 correctional institutions,  

[6:2:66,179] three of which have reception centers, one leased facility, and 34 conservation camps.   The camps perform public conservation  

[6:3:66,189] projects including, but not limited to, forest fire prevention, watershed management, and soil conservation. 

[7:0:66,206] 4545 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - CONTRACTED FACILITIES  

[8:0:66,223] The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Contracted Facilities program is to provide meaningful  

[8:1:66,233] rehabilitative programs in the least restrictive housing to prepare for successful reintegration back to the community. These  

[8:2:66,243] facilities are the Community Correctional Facilities, Community Reentry Facilities, and Community Prisoner Mother Program.  

[8:3:66,253] The final Community Correctional Facility closed on May 30, 2021.   The Community Reentry Facilities and Community Prison  

[8:4:66,262] Mother Programs were realigned to Program 4590 - Rehabilitative Programs – Cognitive Behavioral Treatment and Reentry  

[8:5:66,272] Services as of July 1, 2022.  

[9:0:66,289] 4550 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INSTITUTION ADMINISTRATION  

[10:0:66,307] The Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Institution Administration program is responsible for the management  

[10:1:66,316] and operation of 33 adult institutions, three of which have reception centers, one leased facility, and 34 conservation camps.  

[10:2:66,326] The program is responsible for improving institution programming and operations. This program is also responsible for  

[10:3:66,336] providing facility maintenance, asset management, and construction services for CDCR's adult facilities and other closed  

[10:4:66,346] properties. In addition, the Office of Correctional Safety facilitates institution and public safety via security threat group  

[10:5:66,356] management, escapee apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response training.  

[11:0:66,373] 4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION  

[12:0:66,390] The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and  

[12:1:66,400] degree of successful reintegration and release to society of incarcerated people paroled from state prison. The program is  

[12:2:66,410] responsible for providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The  

[12:3:66,419] Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies utilizes the California Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model  

[12:4:66,429] which incorporates evidence-based practices to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism. Standard and  

[12:5:66,439] specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the incarcerated person's risk  

[12:6:66,449] and current service needs.   Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly scheduled based on parolee  

[12:7:66,459] behavior and stability in the community.   Other components of supervision include the Sex Offender Management Program,  

[12:8:66,468] which incorporates the control and containment model strategy as required by statute, and Global Positioning System (GPS)  

[12:9:66,478] monitoring for all sex offenders.  

[13:0:66,495] The other integral program component is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and  

[13:1:66,505] services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support  

[13:2:66,515] successful transition into local communities.  

[14:0:66,532] 4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS  

[15:0:66,549] Rehabilitative Programs and Parole Operations - Adult Community Based Programs utilize a variety of rehabilitative and  

[15:1:66,559] reentry assistance programs designed to promote successful reintegration of parolees while protecting public safety. These  

[15:2:66,569] programs include, but are not limited to, referrals and linkages to Transitional and Emergency Housing, and Day Reporting  

[15:3:66,579] Centers. Other services include enrollment into Pre-Employment and Transitional Work Programs, Cognitive Behavioral  

[15:4:66,589] Treatment and interventions, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, and other wraparound services. The program includes a full  

[15:5:66,598] continuum of transitional programs, including the Transitional Case Management Program and sex offender treatment for all  

[15:6:66,608] sex offenders on parole.  

[16:0:66,625] The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's community-based Behavioral  

[16:1:66,635] Health Reintegration program, which provides transitional mental health treatment, case management and crisis intervention.  

[16:2:66,645] The objective of these services is to reduce gaps in treatment after release from incarceration pending sustainable connection  

[16:3:66,655] to alternative service providers and necessary resources in the community.  

[17:0:66,672] 4565 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT ADMINISTRATION  

[18:0:66,689] The Parole Operations - Adult Administration provides administration and support functions such as business services,  

[18:1:66,699] contracts, budgeting, and personnel for all programs and staff. The program also includes the leasing of office space, internet/ 

[18:2:66,709] data infrastructure, and utilities for the parole units throughout the state. Also in this program, separate from the Division of

[6:0:164,275] 5227   Board of State and Community Corrections  

[7:0:66,296] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and technical  

[7:1:66,306] assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal justice system.  

[7:2:66,316] This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, intervention,  

[7:3:66,325] suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with  

[7:4:66,335] the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for  

[7:5:66,345] managing criminal justice populations. The Board seeks to ensure that its efforts are systematically informed by experts and  

[7:6:66,355] stakeholders with subject matter expertise. 

[8:0:66,372] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a  

[8:1:66,382] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[6:0:215,286] 5420   Prison Industry Authority  

[7:0:66,307] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries  

[7:1:66,317] in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate  

[7:2:66,327] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections  

[7:3:66,337] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee,  

[7:4:66,346] the Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the  

[7:5:66,356] Speaker of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by  

[7:6:66,366] the Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the  

[7:7:66,376] Board.  

[8:0:66,395] CALPIA supports CDCR’s public safety mission by providing job training programs to incarcerated individuals. These programs  

[8:1:66,405] are to help the incarcerated individuals develop job skills, establish good work habits, and obtain basic education and job  

[8:2:66,415] support so that when they return to their communities they can gain meaningful employment and be productive and successful.  

[8:3:66,424] CALPIA's number one goal is rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.  

[9:0:66,444] CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that  

[9:1:66,454] provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working  

[9:2:66,464] conditions within enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure incarcerated individuals assigned  

[9:3:66,473] therein the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational  

[9:4:66,483] skills; and (3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient  

[9:5:66,493] funds from the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by  

[9:6:66,503] CDCR. CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
