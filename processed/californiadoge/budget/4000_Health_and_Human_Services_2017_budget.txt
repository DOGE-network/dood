[8:0:226,444] 4170 Department of Aging 

[8:1:58,464] The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, 

[8:2:58,473] and families through: 

[9:0:58,489] • 

[9:1:58,498] • 

[9:2:58,507] • 

[9:3:58,516] • 

[10:0:68,491] Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives. 

[10:1:68,500] Opportunities for community involvement. 

[11:0:68,509] Support to family members providing care and. 

[11:1:68,518] Collaboration with other state and local agencies. 

[12:0:58,536] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that 

[12:1:58,545] provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and 

[12:2:58,554] Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that 

[12:3:58,563] operate the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies 

[12:4:58,572] Community-Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid. 

[13:0:58,590] The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At 

[13:1:58,599] the local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, 

[13:2:58,608] adults with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

[10:0:58,331] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[11:0:58,358] 3890 - NUTRITION 

[12:0:58,376] The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60 

[12:1:58,385] years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the 

[12:2:58,394] isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and 

[12:3:58,403] assistance, employment, and education. 

[12:4:58,421] 3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 

[13:0:58,439] The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time 

[13:1:58,448] subsidized training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The 

[13:2:58,457] program also promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 

[13:3:58,475] 3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 

[14:0:58,493] This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 

[14:1:58,502] grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and 

[14:2:58,511] assistance, legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and 

[14:3:58,520] the Long-Term Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access 

[14:4:58,529] the support necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive 

[14:5:58,538] long-term care services appropriate to their needs. 

[14:6:58,556] 3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 

[15:0:58,574] This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP 

[15:1:58,583] provides personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the 

[15:2:58,592] primary local source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, 

[15:3:58,601] and health plans. 

[15:4:58,619] 3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 

[16:0:58,637] This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult 

[16:1:58,646] Services (CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age 

[16:2:58,655] or over who are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or 

[16:3:58,664] disabilities. The Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid 

[16:4:58,673] home and community-based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and 

[16:5:58,682] unnecessary long-term care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing 

[16:6:58,691] facility.

[10:0:58,514] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[11:0:68,530] • 

[12:0:78,532] Current Year Shortfall - The Budget includes increased expenditures in the Medi-Cal program of approximately $1.1 

[12:1:78,541] billion General Fund compared to the 2016 Budget Act. The current year increase is primarily attributable to a one-time 

[12:2:78,550] retroactive payment of drug rebates to the federal government and miscalculation of costs associated with the 

[12:3:78,559] Coordinated Care Initiative in prior estimates. 

[13:0:68,575] • 

[14:0:78,577] Coordinated Care Initiative - Under the Coordinated Care Initiative (CCI) Cal MediConnect program, persons eligible for 

[14:1:78,586] both Medicare and Medi-Cal (dual eligibles) receive medical, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and 

[14:2:78,595] home and community-based services coordinated through a single health plan. Under current law, if the CCI 

[15:0:78,604] demonstration project is not cost effective, the program automatically ceases operation in the following fiscal year. The 

[15:1:78,613] Governor's Budget estimate of the CCI projects that it will no longer be cost-effective. Therefore, consistent with current 

[15:2:78,622] law, the Budget Act assumes the program will be discontinued in 2017-18. Based on the lessons learned from the CCI 

[15:3:78,631] demonstration project, the Budget Act includes the extension of the Cal MediConnect duals demonstration pilot for an 

[15:4:78,640] additional two years, through December 31, 2019. The Budget Act reflects savings of approximately $8.5 million 

[15:5:78,649] General Fund. 

[16:0:68,665] • 

[17:0:78,667] General Fund Share for Medi-Cal Optional Expansion - Beginning in 2018, the state assumes a 6-percent share of cost 

[17:1:78,676] for the optional expansion population. The Budget includes costs of $14.9 billion ($1.5 billion General Fund) in 2017-18 

[17:2:78,685] for this population. 

[18:0:68,701] • 

[19:0:78,703] Proposition 56 - The Budget includes $711.2 million to support new growth in Medi-Cal for expenditures as compared 

[19:1:78,712] to the 2016 Budget Act and $546 million for supplemental provider payments for physician services, dental services, 

[19:2:78,721] women's health, Intermediate Care Facilities for the Developmentally Disabled, and HIV/AIDS waiver providers. The

# === PAGE 54 === [size: 612x792]
[0:0:58,15] 2017-18 STATE BUDGET — HHS 52   HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[1:0:148,44] 4260 Department of Health Care Services - Continued 

[2:0:78,73] $546 million in supplemental provider payments are subject to federal approval, and contingent on continued stability in 

[2:1:78,82] federal Medicaid funding. 

[3:0:68,98] • 

[4:0:78,100] Restoration of Medi-Cal Dental Benefit - The Budget includes $34.7 million in 2017-18 and $72.9 million General Fund 

[4:1:78,109] annually thereafter to restore full dental services for adult beneficiaries in the Medi-Cal program, effective January 1, 

[4:2:78,118] 2018. 

[5:0:68,134] • 

[6:0:78,136] Restoration of Medi-Cal Vision Benefit - The Budget includes statutory changes to restore optometric and optical 

[6:1:78,145] services for adult beneficiaries in the Medi-Cal program, effective January 1, 2020, contingent on the Legislature 

[6:2:78,154] including funding for these services in the state budget process. 

[7:0:68,170] • 

[8:0:78,172] Diabetes Prevention Program - The Budget includes $38,000 in 2017-18 and approximately $5 million General Fund in 

[8:1:78,181] 2018-19 and annually thereafter to implement a Diabetes Prevention Program as a covered Medi-Cal benefit. 

[9:0:68,197] • 

[10:0:78,199] Medically Tailored Meals Pilot Program - The Budget includes $2 million General Fund annually for three years 

[11:0:78,208] beginning in 2017-18 to implement a three-year pilot program to provide medically tailored meals for specified Medi-Cal 

[11:1:78,217] beneficiaries. 

[12:0:68,233] • 

[13:0:78,235] Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing Ratios - The Budget includes an increase in the minimum number of direct care 

[14:0:78,244] services hours in skilled nursing facilities from 3.2 to 3.5 hours per patient day, effective July 1, 2018. It also specifies 

[14:1:78,253] that a minimum of 2.4 hours per patient day must be provided by certified nurse assistants. This change allows for 

[14:2:78,262] waivers of the direct care service hour requirements when there is a shortage of available and appropriate health care 

[14:3:78,271] professionals. This results in estimated costs of approximately $10.4 million General Fund in the Medi-Cal program 

[14:4:78,280] starting in 2018-19. 

[15:0:68,296] • 

[16:0:78,298] California Children's Services Medical Therapy Program - The Budget includes $1.6 million General Fund for non-

[16:1:78,307] medically necessary occupational therapy and physical therapy services. Recent court decisions have required the 

[16:2:78,316] provision of these services if included in a child's written Individualized Education Program, even when they are not 

[16:3:78,325] deemed medically necessary. These services are not eligible for federal financial participation. The Administration will 

[16:4:78,334] continue to work with the Legislature to resolve this issue. 

[17:0:68,350] • 

[18:0:78,352] Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund Abolishment - The Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund funded expenses related to 

[18:1:78,361] the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program (MRMIP), which was originally established as a state high-risk pool. The 

[18:2:78,370] ACA has reduced the need for the high-risk pool because individuals cannot be denied coverage based on a pre-

[18:3:78,379] existing health condition. The Budget abolishes this Fund, and transfers the remaining fund balance to the newly 

[18:4:78,388] established Health Care Services Plan Fines and Penalties Fund to fund MRMIP and the Medi-Cal program. 

[19:0:68,404] • 

[20:0:78,406] Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization - To extend the CHIP program beyond September 2017, 

[20:1:78,415] Congress must pass legislation. Given the uncertainties around what actions Congress may take, the Budget assumes 

[20:2:78,424] the program is reauthorized but at the non-enhanced federal matching percentage of 65% effective October 1, 2017, 

[20:3:78,433] and includes General Fund costs of $396.9 million 

[21:0:68,449] • 

[22:0:78,451] Managed Care Organization Tax - Chapter 2, Statutes of 2016, Second Extraordinary Session (SBx2 2), authorized a 

[22:1:78,460] tax on the enrollment of Medi-Cal managed care plans and commercial health plans, which is in compliance with 

[22:2:78,469] federal Medicaid regulations. This tax funds the nonfederal share of Medi-Cal managed care rates for health care 

[22:3:78,478] services provided to children, adults, seniors and persons with disabilities, and persons eligible for both Medi-Cal and 

[22:4:78,487] Medicare. The Budget Act reduces General Fund spending in the Medi-Cal program by approximately $1.2 billion in 

[22:5:78,496] 2016-17 and $1.8 billion in 2017-18. 

[23:0:68,512] • 

[24:0:78,514] Hospital Quality Assurance Fee Extension - On November 8, 2016, voters passed Proposition 52, which amends the 

[24:1:78,523] state Constitution to permanently extend the existing Hospital Quality Assurance Fee as defined under Chapter 27, 

[24:2:78,532] Statutes of 2016 (AB 1607) . Under prior law, the fee was due to sunset on December 31, 2017. The Budget Act 

[24:3:78,541] assumes General Fund savings of over $1 billion in 2017-18 from the hospital fee.  

[25:0:68,557] • 

[26:0:78,559] AB 85 Redirection of County Savings - Chapter 24, Statutes of 2013 (AB 85), modified the 1991 Realignment Local 

[26:1:78,568] Revenue Health Account distributions to capture and redirect savings counties are experiencing from the 

[27:0:78,577] implementation of federal health care reform. County savings are estimated to be $585.9 million 2016-17 and $688.8 

[27:1:78,586] million in 2017-18. The Budget also includes an adjustment of $255.6 million to account for actual county savings 

[27:2:78,595] based on the reconciliation of the 2014-15 fiscal year. The Budget assumes reimbursement of this amount from the 

[27:3:78,604] counties in 2017-18. The General Fund savings are reflected in the CalWORKS program within the Department of 

[27:4:78,613] Social Services' budget.  

[28:0:68,629] • 

[29:0:78,631] Drug Medi Cal Organized Delivery System Pilot-The Budget includes $124.4 million General Fund for a five-year pilot 

[29:1:78,640] program for participating counties to use an organized delivery system to provide substance use disorder services to 

[29:2:78,649] eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries. A total of 7 counties began providing services in 2016 17 and an additional 9 counties 

[29:3:78,658] are anticipated to begin providing services in 2017 18. 

[30:0:68,674] • 

[31:0:78,676] Performance Outcomes System - The Budget includes $6.2 million General Fund for the implementation of functional 

[31:1:78,685] assessment tools for populations receiving specialty mental health services through county mental health plans. These 

[31:2:78,694] assessment tools will gather data from both a clinician?s and caregiver?s perspective and will be used to track 

[31:3:78,703] outcomes for Medi Cal mental health services provided to children up to age 21. 

[32:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[5:0:58,139] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:58,167] 4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM 

[7:0:58,185] Through the network of regional centers, the Department supports the development and maintenance of services for eligible 

[7:1:58,194] persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers directly provide or coordinate the 

[7:2:58,203] following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, (3) counseling, (4) lifelong 

[7:3:58,212] individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the individual program plan, 

[7:4:58,221] (6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of legal, civil, and service 

[7:5:58,230] rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, placement, and 

[7:6:58,239] monitoring for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, (12) 

[7:7:58,248] community education about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services. The needs of individuals who reside in 

[7:8:58,257] state-operated facilities are assessed and community resources are developed to assist those who can appropriately 

[7:9:58,266] transition to the community. 

[8:0:58,284] The Department monitors regional centers to ensure they operate in accordance with statute, regulations, and their contract 

[8:1:58,293] with the Department. 

[9:0:58,311] 4145 - DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS PROGRAM 

[10:0:58,329] The Department operates three developmental centers: Fairview (Orange County), Porterville (Tulare County), and Sonoma 

[10:1:58,338] (Sonoma County). Secure treatment services are provided at Porterville Developmental Center. In addition, the Department 

[10:2:58,347] leases one small community facility for persons who require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed 

[10:3:58,356] facility in Cathedral City. The developmental centers are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for 

[10:4:58,365] skilled nursing care and intermediate care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility only. Services at all 

[10:5:58,374] facilities involve the provision of active treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including 

[10:6:58,383] appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, assistance with activities of daily living, training, 

[10:7:58,392] education, and employment. 

[11:0:58,410] The primary objectives of the Developmental Centers Program include providing care, treatment, and habilitation services to 

[11:1:58,419] residents based upon assessed need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered 

[11:2:58,428] in the most efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the 

[11:3:58,437] judicial system; and are designed to teach individuals skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or 

[11:4:58,446] improvement of health and welfare, and enhance personal competence in all areas of daily living. 

[12:0:58,464] The Developmental Centers Division provides central administrative and clinical management services to the three 

[12:1:58,473] developmental centers and the leased small community facility to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with 

[12:2:58,482] state licensing and federal certification requirements, protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility 

[12:3:58,491] structures and grounds. Areas of responsibility include the development of policy and procedures for all aspects of the 

[12:4:58,500] developmental centers operations, law enforcement and protective services, facility population management, program and 

[12:5:58,509] fiscal oversight, and facilities planning and support. 

[13:0:58,527] The Department has initiated closure planning for the remaining developmental centers. Sonoma Developmental Center is 

[13:1:58,536] scheduled to close by the end of 2018, with Fairview Developmental Center and the non-secure treatment portion of 

[13:2:58,545] Porterville Developmental Center planned for closure by 2021. 

[14:0:58,563] 4150 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM 

[15:0:58,581] This program provides legal support for the Department through an interagency agreement with the Department of Justice. 

[16:0:58,599] 9900 - DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION 

[17:0:58,617] The objective of this program is to provide to the Department (1) overall management, planning and policy development, 

[17:1:58,626] legal, legislative, audit, and administrative services, and (2) revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state 

[17:2:58,635] programs, insurance companies, and private payers for the cost of services.

[9:0:58,315] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facilities under its 

[9:1:58,324] control, including three state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. 

[9:2:58,333] The facilities are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County, Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County, and 

[9:3:58,342] Sonoma Developmental Center in Sonoma County. The Developmental Centers are comprised of approximately 3.6 million 

[9:4:58,351] gross square feet in 437 buildings on 1,647 acres in total. The Department is also responsible for the maintenance of interior 

[9:5:58,360] finishes and equipment at a 57,000 square foot leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities are used to aid the 

[9:6:58,369] Department's mission to provide medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; and vocational

[3:0:200,136] 4440 Department of State Hospitals 

[3:1:58,156] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission 

[3:2:58,165] is to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital 

[3:3:58,174] operations, across a continuum of care and settings. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of 

[3:4:58,183] mental health treatment of its patients. In 2015-16, State Hospitals served approximately 13,000 patients and the average 

[3:5:58,192] daily inpatient census was approximately 7,000 in a 24 hours a day/7 days a week hospital setting. Additionally, 

[3:6:58,201] approximately 625 individuals received community outpatient treatment through the conditional release program. 

[3:7:58,219] The Department oversees five state hospitals and three psychiatric programs located in state prisons. The five state 

[3:8:58,228] hospitals are Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan - Los Angeles, Napa and Patton. The three psychiatric programs are 

[3:9:58,237] currently operated through a memorandum of understanding with the California Department of Corrections and 

[4:0:58,246] Rehabilitation, and treat inmates in Vacaville, Salinas Valley and Stockton. The Budget reflects the transfer of responsibility 

[4:1:58,255] for the psychiatric programs to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation beginning in 2017-18.  

[4:2:58,273] The Department also provides services in jail-based competency treatment programs and conditional release programs 

[4:3:58,282] serving all 58 counties. 

[5:0:58,300] Because the Department of State Hospitals' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a 

[5:1:58,309] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 

[5:2:58,318] Overview."

[0:0:58,15] 2017-18 STATE BUDGET — HHS 146   HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[1:0:165,44] 4440 Department of State Hospitals - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] Offender Commitment Program, the Restoration of Competency Program, and the treatment and evaluation of judicially and 

[2:1:58,82] civilly committed patients. 

[2:2:58,100] Program Administration 

[3:0:58,118] Program Administration includes headquarters functions that support the state hospital system, including policy development 

[3:1:58,127] and management, licensing oversight, patients' rights coordination, clinical oversight, data research and fiscal management. 

[3:2:58,145] In-Patient Services 

[4:0:58,163] The state hospital system includes five state hospitals: Atascadero, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, Patton, and Coalinga. 

[4:1:58,172] In addition, this program includes three inpatient psychiatric programs located at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, 

[4:2:58,181] Salinas Valley State Prison in Salinas Valley and within the California Health Care Facility in Stockton. The three psychiatric 

[4:3:58,190] programs provide treatment services to CDCR inmates and the responsibility for these facilities is proposed to be transferred 

[4:4:58,199] to CDCR beginning in 2017-18. Mental health treatment services at all facilities are delivered by clinical teams who provide 

[4:5:58,208] full-time inpatient care to the most serious mentally ill and those incapable of living in the community. 

[4:6:58,226] Conditional Release 

[5:0:58,244] The Conditional Release Program (CONREP) is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic 

[5:1:58,253] patients. Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began 

[5:2:58,262] operations on January 1, 1986. 

[6:0:58,280] The goal of CONREP is to provide greater public protection in California communities via a standardized community 

[6:1:58,289] outpatient treatment system. 

[7:0:58,307] Restoration of Competency/Jail-Based Competence Treatment 

[8:0:58,325] The Restoration of Competency (ROC)/Jail-Based Competency Treatment (JBCT) Program focuses on defendants deemed 

[8:1:58,334] Incompetent to Stand Trial in accordance with Penal Code Section 1370. The ROC/JBCT Program provides mental health 

[8:2:58,343] treatment to defendants in a jail-based or community setting, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in 

[8:3:58,352] court proceedings. 

[9:0:58,370] 4385 - FORENSIC EVALUATION SERVICES 

[10:0:58,388] Forensic Evaluation Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO) and the Sex Offender Commitment 

[10:1:58,397] Program (SOCP). The MDO program applies only to prisoners whose crimes were committed on or after January 1, 1986. 

[10:2:58,406] Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets six specific criteria be ordered by the Board of Prison 

[10:3:58,415] Terms to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 

[10:4:58,424] 793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, 

[10:5:58,433] upon release from prison, to be sexually violent predators (SVP). The SOCP administers clinical screenings to determine 

[10:6:58,442] whether an individual is likely to be a SVP and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department. 

[10:7:58,460] 4390 - LEGAL SERVICES 

[11:0:58,478] The Legal Services Division is responsible for providing a full range of comprehensive legal services including, but not 

[11:1:58,487] limited to: developing legislation; providing litigation; protecting the confidentiality and privacy of patient information under 

[11:2:58,496] the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act; providing contract law advice to the state hospitals, psychiatric 

[11:3:58,505] programs and headquarters; and representing the Department at various court and administrative law proceedings involving 

[11:4:58,514] involuntary medication, orders to show cause, and personnel actions statewide.

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES 

[4:0:58,127] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities 

[4:1:58,136] through vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state. In addition, the 

[4:2:58,145] Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (education, mental health, and welfare) to provide 

[4:3:58,154] services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, which gives priority to 

[4:4:58,163] persons with the most significant disabilities. 

[5:0:58,181] Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range 

[5:1:58,190] of services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, and 

[5:2:58,199] independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities. 

[6:0:58,217] The Department provides comprehensive training and supervision to enable persons who are blind or visually impaired to 

[6:1:58,226] support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational services are provided by 

[6:2:58,235] the Orientation Center for the Blind to newly blind adults to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation services and 

[6:3:58,244] independent living. 

[7:0:58,262] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational 

[7:1:58,271] rehabilitation services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation 

[7:2:58,280] Programs, and establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 

[8:0:58,298] The Department works with the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department 

[8:1:58,307] of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Labor to administer the Promoting the Readiness of Minors in 

[8:2:58,316] Supplemental Security Income grant to develop and implement model demonstration projects that promote positive 

[8:3:58,325] outcomes for children who receive Supplemental Security Income and their families to improve the provision and

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 4260 - 4260 CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 

[4:0:58,118] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing 

[4:1:58,127] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and 

[4:2:58,136] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title 

[4:3:58,145] IV-D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the 

[4:4:58,154] Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant. 

[4:5:58,172] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 

[5:0:58,181] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and 

[5:1:58,190] operating expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support 

[5:2:58,199] agencies. The federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration 

[5:3:58,208] costs. 

[6:0:58,226] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 

[7:0:58,235] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal

[7:2:58,253] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer 

[7:3:58,262] accounts, and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child 

[7:4:58,271] Support Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated disbursement unit, which collects child support

[9:0:58,204] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:58,232] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 

[11:0:58,250] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support 

[11:1:58,259] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components: 

[11:2:68,268] California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) 

[12:0:58,265] • 

[12:1:58,274] • 

[13:0:68,277] Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food 

[13:1:68,286] Assistance Programs 

[14:0:58,292] • 

[14:1:58,301] • 

[14:2:58,310] • 

[15:0:68,295] Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program 

[15:1:68,304] County Administration and Automation Projects 

[15:2:68,313] Disaster Relief 

[16:0:58,331] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to 

[16:1:58,340] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to 

[16:2:58,349] monitor, administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 

[17:0:58,367] 4270010 - CalWORKs: 

[18:0:58,376] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. 

[18:1:58,385] CalWORKs is California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary 

[18:2:58,394] assistance to meet basic needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal 

[18:3:58,403] responsibility. CalWORKs includes specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child 

[18:4:58,412] care, to enable an individual to meet these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage 

[18:5:58,421] system to current and former CalWORKs recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain 

[18:6:58,430] conditions). Stage One is administered by the Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by 

[18:7:58,439] the California Department of Education. Parents have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care 

[18:8:58,448] homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the 

[18:9:58,457] work force and engaging children in child care and development services. 

[19:0:58,475] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 

[20:0:58,484] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term 

[20:1:58,493] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian 

[20:2:58,502] as a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This

[26:3:68,664] the minor. 

[27:0:58,679] • 

[28:0:68,682] The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of 

[28:1:68,691] human trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits

[2:0:58,73] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of 

[2:1:58,82] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations 

[2:2:58,91] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal 

[2:3:58,100] benefits due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance 

[2:4:58,109] Program. The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to 

[2:5:58,118] participate in employment and training activities. 

[3:0:58,136] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for 

[3:1:58,145] distribution to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible 

[3:2:58,154] recipients for household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also 

[3:3:58,163] supplemented with food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer 

[3:4:58,172] contributions generated through a state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by 

[3:5:58,181] farmers and businesses. 

[4:0:58,199] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious 

[4:1:58,208] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity 

[4:2:58,217] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social 

[4:3:58,226] Services on October 1, 2016. 

[5:0:58,244] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 

[6:0:58,253] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or 

[6:1:58,262] disabled persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI 

[6:2:58,271] payment with a State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the Federal Social Security 

[6:3:58,280] Administration who determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 

[7:0:58,298] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 

[8:0:58,307] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff 

[8:1:58,316] who administer public assistance programs. 

[9:0:58,334] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 

[10:0:58,352] 4270046 - Disaster Relief: 

[11:0:58,361] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have 

[11:1:58,370] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private 

[11:2:58,379] assistance programs. 

[12:0:58,397] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 

[13:0:58,415] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include 

[13:1:58,424] child welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, 

[13:2:58,433] regulations, and procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring 

[13:3:58,442] and evaluation of the service delivery system. 

[14:0:58,460] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 

[15:0:58,469] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely 

[15:1:58,478] in their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled 

[15:2:58,487] individuals who either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There 

[15:3:58,496] are four programs that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community 

[15:4:58,505] First Choice Option, and IHSS-Residual Program. 

[16:0:58,523] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 

[17:0:58,532] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse 

[17:1:58,541] Prevention. 

[18:0:58,559] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement 

[18:1:58,568] and prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated 

[18:2:58,577] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with 

[18:3:58,586] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and 

[18:4:58,595] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated 

[18:5:58,604] from foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff. 

[19:0:58,622] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter 

[19:1:58,631] 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to 

[19:2:58,640] change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment 

[19:3:58,649] and case planning. 

[20:0:58,667] The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and 

[20:1:58,676] private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for 

[20:2:58,685] children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services 

[20:3:58,694] include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive 

[20:4:58,703] parents; training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country 

[20:5:58,712] adoptions. For independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the 

[20:6:58,721] court when the biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.

[2:2:58,100] services for at risk families and their children. 

[3:0:58,118] The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of physical and financial abuse and 

[3:1:58,127] neglect or exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 

[4:0:58,145] The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health 

[4:1:58,154] and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes 

[4:2:58,163] facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components.

[6:0:58,244] The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project 

[6:1:58,253] provides participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state 

[6:2:58,262] foster care maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable. 

[6:3:58,280] 4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 

[7:0:58,298] The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and

[4:1:58,180] In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties 

[4:2:58,189] increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment 

[4:3:58,198] provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT 

[3:1:58,127] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve 

[3:2:58,136] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding 

[3:3:58,145] stability for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to 

[3:4:58,154] encourage cost-effective approaches to providing services. 

[3:5:58,172] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 

[3:6:58,181] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts 

[3:7:58,190] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs 

[3:8:58,199] specified in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in 

[3:9:58,208] order to ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This 

[3:10:58,217] provision ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars 

[3:11:58,226] annually for county health and social services programs.

[13:1:58,568] Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a 

[13:2:58,577] dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility. 

[13:3:58,595] Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare 

[13:4:58,604] services, and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. 

[13:5:58,613] Therefore, it is appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state 

[13:6:58,622] maintaining an oversight and technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing 

[13:7:58,631] services more efficiently and at less cost. 

[13:8:58,649] The funding sources for realignment are: 

[13:9:68,667] The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax. 

[13:10:68,676] The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 

[14:0:58,664] • 

[14:1:58,673] • 

[15:0:58,694] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts: 

[15:1:68,712] Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services) 

[16:0:58,709] •
