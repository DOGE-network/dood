[1:0:433,13] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:102,32] 7600   California Department of Tax and Fee Administration - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 6275025 - COUNTY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,103] The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human  

[5:1:66,113] resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's County  

[5:2:66,123] Assessment Standards program. This program ensures that taxable properties are enrolled and assessed, and that the 58  

[5:3:66,133] county assessors assess all properties.  

[6:0:66,150] 6275050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,167] The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human  

[7:1:66,177] resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's State-Assessed  

[7:2:66,187] Property program. This program is responsible for valuing and assessing inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used  

[7:3:66,196] by railroads, regulated telephone companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car  

[7:4:66,206] companies. Local jurisdictions use the established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes.  

[8:0:66,224] 6275075 - TIMBER TAX PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,241] This program provides revenue for the Timber Tax Fund. The revenue, less administrative costs, is allocated to the counties  

[9:1:66,251] where the timber was harvested. The CDTFA administers and collects the Timber Yield Tax, a property tax paid by timber  

[9:2:66,260] owners when they harvest trees or timber. The CDTFA determines the harvest values of timber and timberland production zone  

[9:3:66,270] values.  

[10:0:66,287] 6275100 - SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,305] This program ensures that all sales and use tax revenues are collected in an equitable and effective manner through accurate  

[11:1:66,314] reporting of tax liability. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting errors in self-assessments, and promptly collecting  

[11:2:66,324] amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable. Under this program, the CDTFA administers the following taxes:  

[11:3:66,334] State Sales and Use Tax, Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax, and District Transactions and Use Tax (cities/ 

[11:4:66,344] counties).  

[12:0:66,361] 6275125 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TAX PROGRAM  

[13:0:66,378] These programs provide revenue for the Hazardous Waste Control Account (HWCA), the Hazardous Waste Facilities Account  

[13:1:66,388] (HWFA), and the Toxic Substances Control Account (TSCA). The fees provide funding to the Department of Toxic Substances  

[13:2:66,398] Control (DTSC) to regulate hazardous waste in California. Generators of hazardous waste, hazardous waste facilities and  

[13:3:66,408] certain business organizations, as identified by statute, are subject to the fees. CDTFA administers the following fee programs  

[13:4:66,417] in partnership with DTSC: Disposal Fee (HWCA), Generator Fee/Generation and Handling Fee (HWCA), Transportable  

[13:5:66,427] Treatment Unit Fee (HWCA), Facility Fee (HWCA-HWFA), and Environmental Fee (TSCA).  

[14:0:66,444] 6275150 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM

[6:3:66,318] return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the collection and

[8:0:66,439] This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent motor vehicle license fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of

[8:2:66,466] 6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,483] This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of,

[9:2:66,502] personal income tax.  

[9:3:66,520] 6300 - LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,539] This program reimburses the Department of Justice for legal services provided in support of Franchise Tax Board functions.  

[10:1:66,557] 6305 - CONTRACT WORK

[11:0:66,353] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[12:0:66,372] 6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES  

[13:0:66,389] With a multi-billion-dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for  

[13:1:66,399] inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in  

[13:2:66,409] public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds  

[13:3:66,419] are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public  

[13:4:66,428] building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school  

[13:5:66,438] districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)  

[13:6:66,448] Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.  

[14:0:66,465] 6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION  

[15:0:66,482] The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and  

[15:1:66,492] equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties.  

[16:0:66,509] 6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES  

[17:0:66,527] Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid  

[17:1:66,537] redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate  

[17:2:66,546] space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring   protection of lives and  

[17:3:66,556] property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified  

[17:4:66,566] parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their  

[17:5:66,576] programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies,  

[17:6:66,585] and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and  

[17:7:66,595] ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners.  

[18:0:66,612] 6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES  

[19:0:66,630] To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are  

[19:1:66,639] essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and  

[19:2:66,649] leveraged procurement agreements for   information   technology   and non-information technology   goods and services, green and  

[19:3:66,659] sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing  

[19:4:66,669] small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing  

[19:5:66,679] the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include  

[19:6:66,688] travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy  

[19:7:66,698] efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, telework compliance, and budget, accounting, and human  

[20:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[10:0:66,509] This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer  

[10:1:66,519] financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a  

[10:2:66,529] claim with the CalVCB for program benefits.  

[10:3:66,546] 6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,566] This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery  

[11:1:66,575] of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community  

[11:2:66,585] (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition  

[11:3:66,595] and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,  

[11:4:66,605] the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.  

[11:5:66,622] 6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM  

[12:0:66,642] This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that  

[12:1:66,651] benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

[14:1:103,363] Retirement System (CalPERS) in 2023-24 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in

[15:0:103,403] 3/  The 2023 Budget Act estimates 2023-24 state contributions to CalPERS to be $7,727,968,000. The decrease in this  

[15:1:103,414] estimate from the 2023-24 Governor's Budget to the 2023 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans'  

[15:2:103,423] employer contribution rate, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2023 meeting. 

[16:0:103,439] 4/  The 2023 Budget Act estimates 2023-24 administrative expenditures to be $476,118,000, as approved by the CalPERS

[16:3:103,468] the expenditures approved in April 2023.

[17:2:103,512] Budget Act is primarily due to an increase in investment external management fees and technology expenses.

[1:0:433,13] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:201,32] 7900   Public Employees - Continued 

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 6410 - RETIREMENT  

[5:0:66,101] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for  

[5:1:66,111] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of  

[5:2:66,121] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2022, there were about 1,381,000 active and inactive members, and  

[5:3:66,130] about 775,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.  

[6:0:66,150] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  

[6:1:66,160] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,  

[6:2:66,169] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract  

[6:3:66,179] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit  

[6:4:66,189] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.  

[7:0:66,209] As of June 30, 2022, there were 2,892 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and  

[7:1:66,218] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their  

[7:2:66,228] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency  

[7:3:66,238] retirement systems.  

[8:0:66,257] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.  

[9:0:66,275] 6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY  

[10:0:66,294] CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the  

[10:1:66,304] federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age,  

[10:2:66,314] Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.   As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the  

[10:3:66,324] liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.   The program is responsible for  

[10:4:66,333] administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting  

[10:5:66,343] and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 

[11:0:66,360] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS  

[12:0:66,380] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee  

[12:1:66,390] associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees,  

[12:2:66,399] retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs,  

[12:3:66,409] provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer  

[12:4:66,419] representatives.  

[13:0:66,439] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,  

[13:1:66,448] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all  

[13:2:66,458] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial  

[13:3:66,468] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.  

[14:0:66,485] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS  

[15:0:66,505] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the  

[15:1:66,514] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired  

[15:2:66,524] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'  

[15:3:66,534] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $439.4 billion, as of June 30, 2022.  

[16:0:66,551] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION  

[17:0:66,569] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of  

[17:1:66,578] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy  

[17:2:66,588] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term  

[17:3:66,598] Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

[11:0:206,511] 7910   Office of Administrative Law  

[12:0:66,532] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state  

[12:1:66,541] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these  

[12:2:66,551] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also  

[12:3:66,561] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been  

[12:4:66,571] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through  

[12:5:66,581] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative  

[12:6:66,590] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members  

[12:7:66,600] of the public regarding California rulemaking law.  

[13:0:66,620] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies  

[13:1:66,629] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the  

[13:2:66,639] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.  

[14:0:66,659] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the  

[14:1:66,669] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[5:0:187,202] 7920   State Teachers' Retirement System  

[5:1:66,223] The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution  

[5:2:66,232] plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred  

[5:3:66,242] compensation plans and programs:  

[5:4:65,259] • State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP)  

[6:0:65,275] • CalSTRS Pension2 Personal Wealth Plan (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans)  

[6:1:65,291] • Teachers' Health Benefits Fund  

[6:2:65,307] • Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund  

[7:0:66,324] CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school  

[7:1:66,334] teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of  

[7:2:66,344] June 30, 2022, there were over one million members, retirees, and beneficiaries in the STRP Defined Benefit Program.  

[8:0:66,363] CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement  

[8:1:66,373] Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS  

[4:0:66,103] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the  

[4:1:66,113] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the  

[4:2:66,123] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement  

[4:3:66,133] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may  

[4:4:66,142] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the  

[4:5:66,152] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's  

[4:6:66,162] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or  

[4:7:66,172] contract provisions.  

[5:0:66,191] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the  

[5:1:66,201] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of  

[5:2:66,211] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
