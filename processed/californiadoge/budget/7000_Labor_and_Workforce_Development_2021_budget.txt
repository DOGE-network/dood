[5:0:66,452] The objective of the Employment and Employment Related Services Program is to provide a variety of services to facilitate a  

[5:1:66,462] match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an internet labor exchange system to facilitate  

[5:2:66,472] this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to  

[5:3:66,483] provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans,  

[5:4:66,493] youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited

[6:0:66,541] The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct  

[6:1:66,551] impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax  

[6:2:66,561] liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one  

[6:3:66,572] each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly.  

[7:0:66,592] The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the  

[7:1:66,602] Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit  

[7:2:66,612] programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction.  

[7:3:66,630] 5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,651] The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California  

[8:1:66,661] workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income  

[8:2:66,671] replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  

[8:3:66,689] 5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM

[3:3:66,99] covered active duty of the individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States.  

[3:4:66,117] 5930 - TAX PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,135] The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax  

[4:1:66,145] collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support  

[4:2:66,155] the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs.  

[4:3:66,173] 5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL  

[5:0:66,190] The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including  

[5:1:66,201] small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages  

[5:2:66,211] and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention  

[5:3:66,221] and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes  

[5:4:66,231] special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout  

[5:5:66,241] the state.  

[6:0:66,259] 5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  

[7:0:66,280] The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment  

[7:1:66,290] Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide  

[7:2:66,300] and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California SM   in local  

[7:3:66,314] communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce,  

[7:4:66,324] veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to  

[7:5:66,334] job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention,  

[7:6:66,345] earnings, and occupational skills of participants.  

[7:7:66,362] 5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS  

[8:0:66,383] The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as the National Emergency Grant Program,

[8:2:66,403] to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to  

[8:3:66,413] react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

[8:0:66,363] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:1:66,383] 6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD  

[9:0:66,403] The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the  

[9:1:66,413] Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public  

[9:2:66,423] sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and  

[9:3:66,434] dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by  

[9:4:66,444] the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial   courts.  

[10:0:66,464] The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to:  

[10:1:65,482] • Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively  

[10:2:76,492] represent them in their labor relations with their employer.  

[11:0:65,508] • Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees,  

[11:1:76,519] and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws.  

[11:2:65,535] • Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings.  

[11:3:65,551] • Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it  

[11:4:76,561] administers.  

[12:0:66,589] OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL  

[13:0:66,609] The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and  

[13:1:66,620] presiding over informal settlement conferences. The Office of the General Counsel also oversees the statutory process through  

[13:2:66,630] which employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their  

[13:3:66,640] employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains  

[13:4:66,650] enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions.  

[14:0:66,671] DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW  

[15:0:66,691] The Division of Administrative Law conducts adjudicative proceedings, which includes the presentation of evidence and  

[15:1:66,701] examination of witnesses under oath. Proposed decisions are issued consisting of written findings of fact and legal conclusions.  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[4:2:66,109] employee organizations, conducts consent elections, and performs other representation-related work. In addition, the division  

[4:3:66,120] provides lists of arbitrators, interpersonal workplace conflict resolution mediation, and training on a variety of collective

[5:0:66,409] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,429] 6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS  

[6:0:66,446] This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group of  

[6:1:66,456] employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is  

[6:2:66,467] actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-

[6:3:66,477] sector employer post a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer  

[6:4:66,487] defaults on its obligations.  

[7:0:66,505] 6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[8:0:66,522] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize  

[8:1:66,533] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides  

[8:2:66,543] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits.  

[8:3:66,553] The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system  

[8:4:66,563] required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured  

[8:5:66,573] Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and  

[8:6:66,584] sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system  

[8:7:66,594] designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system.  

[8:8:66,604] Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical  

[8:9:66,614] Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-

[8:10:66,624] based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by  

[8:11:66,635] identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system.  

[9:0:66,652] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'  

[10:0:66,663] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court,  

[10:1:66,673] and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.

[1:0:378,13] LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 

[2:0:154,32] 7350   Department of Industrial Relations - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for monitoring the workers’ compensation  

[3:1:66,79] and health and safety program. This involves conducting continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the  

[3:2:66,89] state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and occupational diseases, which includes making recommendations on how to  

[3:3:66,99] improve the workers' compensation and health and safety program, as well as maintaining the occupational safety and health  

[3:4:66,109] training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services coordinator. The Commission conducts  

[3:5:66,120] specified surveys and evaluations required by law and issues an annual report on the state of the workers' compensation  

[3:6:66,130] system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications. The Commission also issues, if necessary, a  

[3:7:66,140] report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices required to be provided by insurers and self-

[3:8:66,150] insured employers.  

[4:0:66,168] 6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  

[5:0:66,186] The Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) promotes and enforces the sections of the Labor Code that protect  

[5:1:66,196] the health and safety of workers on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways,  

[5:2:66,206] and pressure vessels for the benefit of the general public. The coordinated efforts of Cal/OSHA, the Occupational Safety and  

[5:3:66,216] Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (Appeals Board)  

[5:4:66,226] accomplish these objectives.  

[6:0:66,244] Cal/OSHA enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries and  

[6:1:66,254] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. Cal/OSHA conducts inspections and issues permits for the  

[6:2:66,265] operation of elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways and pressure vessels. The  

[6:3:66,275] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these  

[6:4:66,285] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, Cal/OSHA also obtains and maintains job safety  

[6:5:66,295] records, reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and  

[6:6:66,305] provides accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by  

[6:7:66,316] state and local government.  

[7:0:66,333] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as  

[7:1:66,343] follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor,  

[7:2:66,354] one member from the field of occupational health and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in  

[7:3:66,364] the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards  

[7:4:66,374] enforced by Cal/OSHA.  

[8:0:66,392] The Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations and  

[8:1:66,402] accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by Cal/OSHA for occupational safety and health standards violations. It is  

[8:2:66,412] comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from  

[8:3:66,422] the field of management and one member from the field of labor.  

[9:0:66,440] 6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT  

[10:0:66,458] The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (Labor Commissioner’s Office) interprets and enforces the sections of the Labor  

[10:1:66,468] Code which relate to wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees  

[10:2:66,478] engaged in protected activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders. This work is conducted  

[10:3:66,488] by providing field enforcement of laws governing public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed  

[10:4:66,499] contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the payment of overtime and minimum wage; making wage determinations  

[10:5:66,509] and collecting unpaid wages; the licensing of specific industries; the payment of wages without required deductions;  

[11:0:66,519] administration of the prevailing wage program and enforcement of apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works  

[11:1:66,529] projects. Under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, the Labor Commissioner’s Office conducts vigorous and  

[11:2:66,539] targeted enforcement in partnership with state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the  

[11:3:66,550] "underground economy".  

[12:0:66,567] 6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS  

[13:0:66,585] The Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS) matches the needs of workers with those of employers, and strengthens the  

[13:1:66,595] apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting workers and teaching the skills they and  

[13:2:66,605] their employers need. The goals of DAS are to promote, develop and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs,  

[13:3:66,616] as well as provide consultation services to program sponsors. DAS administers the apprenticeship system in California. This  

[13:4:66,626] includes initial program approval and subsequent oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor  

[13:5:66,636] Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. The  

[13:6:66,646] California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the general  

[13:7:66,656] policy under which this program operates.  

[14:0:66,674] 6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES  

[15:0:66,692] The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers'  

[15:1:66,702] compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required  

[15:2:66,712] under the Labor Code.

[3:0:66,69] The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor  

[3:1:66,79] Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be  

[3:2:66,89] disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
