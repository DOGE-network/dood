[5:0:228,169] 4170   Department of Aging  

[6:0:66,191] The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, and  

[6:1:66,201] families through:  

[7:0:65,219] • Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives,  

[7:1:65,235] • Opportunities for community involvement,  

[8:0:65,251] • Support to family members providing care, and  

[8:1:65,267] • Collaboration with other state and local agencies.  

[9:0:66,285] As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that  

[9:1:66,295] provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and  

[10:0:66,305] Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate  

[10:1:66,316] the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-

[10:2:66,326] Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid.  

[11:0:66,346] The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the  

[11:1:66,356] local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults  

[11:2:66,367] with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

[5:2:66,165] legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term  

[5:3:66,175] Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support  

[5:4:66,186] necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care  

[5:5:66,196] services appropriate to their needs.

[7:3:66,318] Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-

[7:4:66,328] based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term  

[7:5:66,338] care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

[6:0:207,363] 4265   Department of Public Health  

[7:0:66,385] The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all  

[7:1:66,395] Californians through the following core activities:  

[7:2:65,413] • Protecting the public from communicable diseases.  

[7:3:65,429] • Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments, and improving social determinants of health and healthy  

[7:4:76,439] communities.  

[8:0:65,455] • Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities by embedding health and  

[8:1:76,466] mental health equity language, tools, and approaches into all public health and partner agency policies, programs, systems,  

[8:2:76,476] and resource allocation.  

[8:3:65,492] • Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.  

[8:4:65,508] • Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to  

[8:5:76,518] guide public health strategies, programs, and actions.  

[8:6:65,535] • Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces.  

[8:7:65,551] • Providing access to quality, population-based health services.  

[8:8:66,568] Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to  

[8:9:66,579] support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[4:0:176,140] 4300   Department of Developmental Services  

[5:0:66,162] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for  

[5:1:66,172] providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and  

[5:2:66,182] productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides  

[5:3:66,192] leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the  

[6:0:66,203] developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems  

[6:1:66,213] that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies  

[6:2:66,223] known as regional centers as well as through state-operated facilities. The Department, through the 21 regional centers,  

[6:3:66,233] oversees coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities; provides that such services are planned,  

[6:4:66,243] provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to the extent possible,  

[6:5:66,254] accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community.  

[7:0:66,271] Because the Department of Developmental Services' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has  

[7:1:66,282] a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

[1:0:419,13] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

[2:0:141,32] 4300   Department of Developmental Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, (12) community education  

[3:1:66,79] about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services.  

[4:0:66,97] 4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,114] The Department currently operates two residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County) and Porterville  

[5:1:66,124] Developmental Center (Tulare County). Secure treatment services are provided at the Porterville Developmental Center  

[5:2:66,135] for   individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial due to their developmental disability. The Department is  

[5:3:66,145] projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences in Northern, Central, and  

[5:4:66,155] Southern California   to provide acute crisis services in the community.   The Department also leases one small community facility  

[5:5:66,165] for persons who require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed facility in Cathedral City (Riverside  

[5:6:66,175] County).  

[6:0:66,193] All   residential facilities are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for skilled nursing care and intermediate  

[6:1:66,203] care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility, and STAR residences operate as community crisis homes.  

[6:2:66,214] Services at all facilities involve the provision of active treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis,  

[6:3:66,224] including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and assistance with activities of daily living,  

[6:4:66,234] training, education, and employment.  

[7:0:66,252] Individuals served in the STAR crisis   residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and  

[7:1:66,262] habilitation services during a crisis and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their  

[7:2:66,272] residential home or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program   is to provide a safety net of  

[7:3:66,282] services that include providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed  

[7:4:66,292] need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and  

[7:5:66,303] least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system; and are designed to teach  

[7:6:66,313] individuals the skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance  

[7:7:66,323] personal competence in all areas of daily living.  

[8:0:66,341] Fairview Developmental Center and the non-secure treatment portion of Porterville Developmental Center transitioned the last  

[8:1:66,351] resident into a community setting in February 2020.  

[9:0:66,369] 4149 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION  

[10:0:66,389] The objective of this program is to: (1) provide overall management, planning and policy development, legal, legislative, audit,  

[10:1:66,399] and administrative services; (2) manage revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state programs, insurance  

[10:2:66,409] companies, and private payers for the cost of services; (3) monitor regional center operations for compliance with statute,  

[10:3:66,420] regulations, and their contract with the Department; (4) provide central administrative and clinical management services to  

[10:4:66,430] the   state-operated residential (developmental center) and community   facilities to oversee the quality of services provided,  

[10:5:66,440] compliance with state licensing and federal certification requirements, protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of  

[10:6:66,450] facility structures and grounds; and (5) oversee areas that include the development of policies and procedures for  

[10:7:66,460] developmental center operations, law enforcement and protective services, facility population management, program and fiscal  

[10:8:66,471] oversight, and facility planning and support.

[9:0:66,531] INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW  

[9:1:66,550] The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facilities under its control,  

[9:2:66,560] including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities  

[9:3:66,571] are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County.  

[9:4:66,588] The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet in 319   buildings on 784 acres.   As of  

[9:5:66,599] February 2020, the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former residents  

[9:6:66,609] to community living.   The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until disposition  

[9:7:66,619] of the property.   The Department is projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR)  

[9:8:66,629] programs that provide acute crisis services in the community.   Additionally, the Department is responsible for the maintenance  

[9:9:66,639] of interior finishes and equipment at Canyon Springs,   a 57,000-square-foot leased facility in Riverside County.   These facilities  

[9:10:66,650] are used to aid the Department's mission   in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision;  

[9:11:66,660] education; and vocational training for residents with developmental disabilities.

[10:0:201,469] 4440   Department of State Hospitals  

[11:0:66,490] The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is  

[11:1:66,501] to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital  

[11:2:66,511] operations, across a continuum of care. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health  

[11:3:66,521] treatment for its patients in five state hospitals located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and  

[11:4:66,531] Patton,   and employs over 13,000 staff. Additionally, the Department provides services in jail-based competency treatment  

[11:5:66,541] programs and conditional release programs throughout the 58 counties. In 2019-20, the Department served 10,962 patients  

[11:6:66,552] within state hospitals and jail-based facilities, with average daily censuses of 6,143 and   333 respectively. The conditional

[15:1:66,454] hospital is California’s newest forensic mental health hospital and was created to primarily treat SVPs. It is a self-contained  

[15:2:66,465] psychiatric hospital constructed with a security perimeter. CDCR provides perimeter security as well as transportation of  

[15:3:66,475] patients to outside medical services and court proceedings. The majority of the all-male patient population is remanded for  

[15:4:66,485] treatment by   Superior Courts or CDCR pursuant to various sections of the California Penal Code and the Welfare and  

[15:5:66,495] Institutions Code.

[17:0:66,531] 4410030 - METROPOLITAN  

[18:0:66,548] The Department of State Hospitals-Metropolitan opened in 1916 and is located in Norwalk (Los Angeles County). The hospital  

[18:1:66,559] is an open style campus within a security perimeter. Due to concerns raised by the community, DSH-Metropolitan maintains a  

[18:2:66,569] formal agreement with the City of Norwalk and the Los Angeles County Sheriff not to accept patients charged with murder or a  

[18:3:66,579] sex crime, or that are at high risk for escape.  

[19:0:66,597] DSH-Metropolitan primarily serves the following four patient types: LPS, IST, OMD, and NGI.  

[20:0:66,614] 4410040 - NAPA  

[21:0:66,632] The Department of State Hospitals-Napa opened in 1875 and is located in Napa County. The hospital   was the first of the

[2:0:166,32] 4440   Department of State Hospitals - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Department of State Hospitals-Patton opened in 1893 and is located in San Bernardino County. The hospital has an open  

[3:1:66,79] style campus with a security perimeter. CDCR correctional officers provide perimeter security and transportation at DSH-Patton  

[3:2:66,89] as well as transportation of patients to outside medical services and some court proceedings.  

[4:0:66,107] DSH-Patton primarily serves the following five patient types: LPS, IST, OMD, NGI and female  Coleman   patients from CDCR.  

[5:0:66,124] 4410060 - HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER ACADEMY  

[6:0:66,142] The Department of State Hospitals Police Officer (HPO) Academy is overseen by the Office of Protective Services, which is a  

[6:1:66,152] full service law enforcement agency that protects the safety and security of the state hospital facilities, staff and patients. DSH  

[6:2:66,163] provides training standards, model programs, cultural competency, program development, and a comprehensive training plan  

[6:3:66,173] to all protective services staff. The HPO Academy requires that cadets successfully complete 548 hours of multidisciplinary  

[6:4:66,183] training specific to the DSH police officer job specifications.  

[7:0:66,201] 4420 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM  

[8:0:66,221] The Conditional Release Program is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients.  

[8:1:66,231] Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began operations on  

[8:2:66,241] January 1, 1986.  

[9:0:66,259] 4420010 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,277] The Conditional Release Program General/Non-Sexually Violent Predators is comprised of   NGI, OMD, IST and SVP.  

[10:1:66,287] Individuals suitable for this program may be recommended by the state hospital medical director to the courts for outpatient  

[10:2:66,297] treatment. Currently, DSH contracts with seven county-operated and three private organizations   serving all 58 counties in the  

[10:3:66,307] state with non-SVP commitments.  

[11:0:66,325] 4420020 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM -   SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS  

[12:0:66,343] The Conditional Release Program-Sexually Violent Predators was added to the Conditional Release Program effective January  

[12:1:66,353] 1, 1996 per Welfare and Institutions Code 6604. Prior to the conditional release of the first   SVP in 2003,   conditional release  

[12:2:66,363] providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators as patients, requiring the  

[12:3:66,373] Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving 58 counties. Current statue  

[12:4:66,384] requires SVPs be conditionally released to their county of domicile and sufficient funding be available to provide treatment and  

[12:5:66,394] supervision services when an   SVP is conditionally released into the community by court order.  

[13:0:66,412] 4430 - CONTRACTED PATIENT SERVICES  

[14:0:66,432] The Department of State Hospitals contracts with local entities to provide mental health services to some of its patients outside  

[14:1:66,442] of state hospital facilities. This includes both the   Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County as well as  

[14:2:66,452] various other   jail-based competency treatment programs.  

[15:0:66,470] 4430010 - ADMISSION, EVALUATION, STABILIZATION CENTER 

[16:0:66,488] The Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County Jail receives   IST patients committed to the  

[16:1:66,498] Department of State Hospitals directly from catchment counties in southern California. Patients receive a full evaluation upon  

[16:2:66,508] admission to determine whether they can be treated through the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center on a short-

[16:3:66,518] term basis or may need longer-term state hospital treatment. Patients considered to be short-term can be treated and  

[16:4:66,529] discharged directly from the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center.  

[17:0:66,546] 4430020 - JAIL-BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT  

[18:0:66,564] The Jail-Based Competency Treatment Program focuses on defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial and provides  

[18:1:66,574] mental health treatment to defendants in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court  

[18:2:66,584] proceedings.  

[19:0:66,602] 4440 - EVALUATION AND FORENSIC SERVICES  

[20:0:66,620] Evaluation and Forensic Services is comprised of the   OMD and the Sex Offender Commitment Programs. Penal Code  

[20:1:66,630] Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of Parole Hearings to be  

[20:2:66,640] treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs evaluations to determine if  

[20:3:66,650] individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the   OMD program. These evaluations are used by the Board of Parole Hearings  

[20:4:66,661] in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and  

[20:5:66,671] Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new  

[20:6:66,681] category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to be an SVP. The Sex Offender Commitment  

[20:7:66,691] Program administers clinical screenings and performs evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for  

[20:8:66,701] an SVP commitment to the Department of State Hospitals upon completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the

[5:0:66,286] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,306] 4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS  

[7:0:66,323] The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through  

[7:1:66,333] financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services.  

[8:0:66,351] The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households  

[8:1:66,361] to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related  

[8:2:66,372] emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard  

[8:3:66,382] the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which  

[8:4:66,392] supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used  

[8:5:66,402] along with LIHEAP weatherization related services.  

[9:0:66,420] The Low Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) is designed to provide financial assistance to low-income  

[9:1:66,430] households that pay a high proportion of household income for drinking water and wastewater services, by providing funds to  

[9:2:66,440] owners or operators of public water systems or treatment works to reduce arrearages of, and rates charged to, such  

[9:3:66,450] households for these services.  

[10:0:66,471] The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-

[10:1:66,481] income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants.  

[11:0:66,499] The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides energy efficiency and renewable energy services in low-income  

[11:1:66,509] single-family and multi-family dwellings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs. LIWP projects include  

[11:2:66,519] weatherization and solar photovoltaic systems installations.  

[12:0:66,537] The California Arrearage Payment Program (CAPP) is designed to prevent energy utility disconnections for households  

[12:1:66,547] experiencing financial hardship due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing financial assistance to  

[12:2:66,557] customer accounts in arrears.  

[13:0:66,593] 4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES  

[14:0:66,610] The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community  

[14:1:66,621] organizations to help low-income families achieve and maintain economic security through a broad range of activities. These  

[14:2:66,631] activities include education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health  

[14:3:66,641] and nutritional services. Additionally, CSBG funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-income  

[14:4:66,651] communities.  

[15:0:66,669] The California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax  

[15:1:66,679] credits to boost the income of eligible individuals and families. Since 2017-18,   the Department   has worked with the Franchise  

[15:2:66,689] Tax Board to provide grant opportunities for community-based organizations to increase awareness of CalEITC.

[2:0:170,32] 5160   Department of Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES  

[5:0:66,103] The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities through  

[5:1:66,113] vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that persons with disabilities  

[5:2:66,123] may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In addition, the  

[5:3:66,133] Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education, behavioral/ 

[5:4:66,143] mental health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection  

[5:5:66,154] process, which gives priority to persons with the most significant disabilities.  

[6:0:66,171] Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of  

[6:1:66,181] services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, supported  

[6:2:66,192] employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their  

[6:3:66,202] communities. The Department provides Work Incentives Planning services to reduce dependency on public benefits. The  

[6:4:66,212] Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals working in non-

[6:5:66,222] competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment.  

[7:0:66,240] The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and  

[7:1:66,250] auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16 up to  

[7:2:66,260] 22 (depending on their exit from their special education program), including many who may benefit from early career  

[7:3:66,271] development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary  

[7:4:66,281] education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy. 

[8:0:66,298] The Department, through its Business Enterprises Program, provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to  

[8:1:66,309] enable persons who are blind or visually impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and  

[8:2:66,319] cafeterias. Prevocational, including employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to  

[8:3:66,329] consumers with vision loss to prepare them for independent living.  

[9:0:66,347] The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation  

[9:1:66,357] services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and  

[9:2:66,367] establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.  

[10:0:66,385] The Department works with the federal government to administer the California Career Innovations Demonstration Project to  

[10:1:66,395] identify how to increase the self-sufficiency of students with disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and  

[10:2:66,405] planned education to prepare them for workplace success.  

[11:0:66,423] 4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES  

[12:0:66,441] The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout  

[12:1:66,451] California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently   with full  

[12:2:66,461] inclusion   in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems  

[12:3:66,471] change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion  

[12:4:66,481] services to community based living, and   transition services to postsecondary life for youth.  

[13:0:66,499] The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their  

[13:1:66,509] families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with  

[13:2:66,520] TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for  

[13:3:66,530] family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to  

[13:4:66,540] administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a  

[13:5:66,550] statewide TBI registry, needs assessment, and resource plan.  

[14:0:66,568] The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 17 non-profit community-based  

[14:1:66,578] organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually  

[14:2:66,588] impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low  

[14:3:66,598] vision evaluations/screenings, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills,  

[14:4:66,609] independent living skills training, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.  

[15:0:66,626] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION  

[16:0:66,647] The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services  

[16:1:66,657] to departmental programs.

[2:0:144,32] 5175   Department of Child Support Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,103] The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing  

[4:1:66,113] parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and  

[4:2:66,123] enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-

[4:3:66,133] D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary  

[4:4:66,143] Assistance for Needy Families block grant.  

[4:5:66,161] 4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION:  

[5:0:66,179] The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating  

[5:1:66,189] expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The  

[5:2:66,199] federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.  

[5:3:66,217] 4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:  

[6:0:66,235] Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal  

[6:1:66,245] certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State  

[6:2:66,255] Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts  

[6:3:66,265] and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support  

[6:4:66,275] Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments  

[6:5:66,286] from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program  

[6:6:66,296] provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

[2:0:166,32] 5180   Department of Social Services - Continued 

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,85] 4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS  

[5:0:66,105] The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support  

[5:1:66,115] themselves. These programs are comprised of five components:  

[6:0:65,133] • California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)  

[7:0:65,149] • Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food  

[7:1:76,160] Assistance Programs  

[8:0:65,176] • Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program  

[9:0:65,192] • County Administration and Automation Projects  

[10:0:65,208] • Disaster Relief  

[11:0:66,236] The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to  

[11:1:66,246] enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,  

[11:2:66,256] administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.  

[12:0:66,274] 4270010 - CalWORKs:  

[13:0:66,284] The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is  

[13:1:66,295] California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic  

[13:2:66,305] needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes  

[13:3:66,315] specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet  

[13:4:66,325] these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs  

[13:5:66,335] recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the  

[13:6:66,346] Department of Social Services. Parents have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or  

[13:7:66,356] license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and  

[13:8:66,366] engaging children in child care and development services.  

[14:0:66,384] 4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:  

[15:0:66,394] The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term  

[15:1:66,404] residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as  

[15:2:66,414] a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is  

[15:3:66,424] administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social  

[15:4:66,435] Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to  

[15:5:66,445] relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system.  

[16:0:66,465] The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate  

[16:1:66,475] the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in  

[16:2:66,486] accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and  

[16:3:66,496] state law.  

[17:0:66,516] California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:  

[18:0:65,534] • The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States  

[18:1:76,544] provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.  

[19:0:65,580] • The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and  

[19:1:76,590] independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States  

[19:2:76,600] unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the  

[19:3:76,610] minor.  

[20:0:65,646] • The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human  

[20:1:76,656] trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are  

[20:2:76,666] available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under  

[20:3:76,676] CalWORKs).  

[21:0:66,704] The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of  

[21:1:66,714] nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,69] purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations  

[3:1:66,79] eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits  

[3:2:66,89] due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.  

[3:3:66,99] The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in  

[3:4:66,109] employment and training activities.  

[4:0:66,130] The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution  

[4:1:66,140] to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for  

[4:2:66,150] household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with  

[4:3:66,160] food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a  

[4:4:66,171] state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.  

[5:0:66,191] The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious  

[5:1:66,201] supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity  

[5:2:66,211] Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services  

[5:3:66,222] on October 1, 2016.  

[6:0:66,239] 4270020 - Child Care and Development:  

[7:0:66,257] The Child Care Development program reflects services that will transition to the Department of Social Services administration  

[7:1:66,267] from the Department of Education, effective July 1, 2021. This includes but is not limited to Stages Two and Three of child care,  

[7:2:66,277] migrant day care, and Child and Adult Care Food Programs.  

[8:0:66,295] 4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:  

[9:0:66,313] The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled  

[9:1:66,323] persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a  

[9:2:66,333] State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who  

[9:3:66,343] determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.  

[10:0:66,361] 4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:  

[11:0:66,379] Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who  

[11:1:66,389] administer public assistance programs.  

[12:0:66,407] Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.  

[13:0:66,424] 4270046 - Disaster Relief:  

[14:0:66,442] The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have  

[14:1:66,452] suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance  

[14:2:66,463] programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select  

[14:3:66,473] recovery grants.  

[15:0:66,490] 4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING  

[16:0:66,508] The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child  

[16:1:66,518] welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and  

[16:2:66,529] procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of  

[16:3:66,539] the service delivery system.  

[17:0:66,556] 4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:  

[18:0:66,574] The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in  

[18:1:66,584] their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who  

[18:2:66,595] either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs  

[18:3:66,605] that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,  

[18:4:66,615] and IHSS-Residual Program.  

[19:0:66,633] 4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:  

[20:0:66,643] The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse  

[20:1:66,653] Prevention.  

[21:0:66,673] Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and  

[21:1:66,684] prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated  

[21:2:66,694] services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with  

[21:3:66,704] the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and  

[21:4:66,714] least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from  

[22:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[3:0:66,69] foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.  

[4:0:66,89] In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is responsible   for implementing continuum of care  

[4:1:66,99] reforms   codified in Chapter 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to  

[4:2:66,109] services without having to change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and  

[4:3:66,120] families in assessment and case planning.  

[5:0:66,137] The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and  

[5:1:66,148] private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for  

[5:2:66,158] children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services  

[5:3:66,168] include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents;  

[5:4:66,178] training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For  

[5:5:66,188] independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the  

[5:6:66,199] biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.  

[6:0:66,219] The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and  

[6:1:66,229] sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and  

[6:2:66,239] services for at risk families and their children.  

[7:0:66,260] The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of abuse, neglect, or financial  

[7:1:66,270] exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary.  

[8:0:66,290] The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health  

[8:1:66,301] and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes  

[8:2:66,311] facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components.  

[8:3:66,328] 4275028 - Special Programs:  

[9:0:66,339] These programs include but are not limited to programs such as Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance,  

[9:1:66,349] Access Assistance to the Deaf,   Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services, and Legal Services for  

[9:2:66,359] Unaccompanied and Undocumented Minors.  

[9:3:66,377] 4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES  

[10:0:66,394] The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and  

[10:1:66,405] provide administrative services to other agencies.  

[10:2:66,422] 4285010 - Disability Evaluation:  

[11:0:66,440] The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents  

[11:1:66,450] applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of  

[11:2:66,460] the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and  

[11:3:66,471] overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.  

[11:4:66,488] 4285019 - Services to Other Agencies:  

[12:0:66,499] In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative  

[12:1:66,509] services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human  

[12:2:66,519] Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public  

[12:3:66,529] information services.

[8:0:66,357] increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment  

[8:1:66,367] provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

[3:0:66,66] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,85] 4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT  

[4:0:66,105] The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve  

[4:1:66,115] improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability  

[4:2:66,126] for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage  

[4:3:66,136] cost-effective approaches to providing services.  

[5:0:66,156] Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[5:1:66,166] Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts  

[5:2:66,177] are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified  

[5:3:66,187] in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to  

[5:4:66,197] ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision  

[5:5:66,207] ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for  

[5:6:66,217] county health and social services programs.

[4:0:202,117] 5196   2011 State-Local Realignment  

[4:1:66,139] Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a  

[4:2:66,149] dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility.  

[4:3:66,169] Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services,  

[4:4:66,180] and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is  

[4:5:66,190] appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and  

[4:6:66,200] technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at  

[4:7:66,210] less cost.  

[4:8:66,231] The funding sources for realignment are:  

[4:9:65,248] • The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.  

[4:10:65,264] • The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.  

[5:0:66,292] Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:  

[5:1:65,310] • Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services)  

[5:2:65,326] • Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care;  

[5:3:76,336] Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment)  

[5:4:65,353] • Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs)  

[5:5:65,369] • Trial Court Security Subaccount  

[6:0:65,385] • Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and  

[6:1:76,395] Adult Parole)  

[6:2:65,411] • Community Corrections Subaccount  

[6:3:65,428] • District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount  

[7:0:65,444] • Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant  

[7:1:76,454] Special Account)  

[8:0:66,482] The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on  

[8:1:66,492] statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures.  

[9:0:66,513] Note the $5.3 billion in   2020-21 and $5.6 billion in   2021-22 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety  

[9:1:66,523] programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full
