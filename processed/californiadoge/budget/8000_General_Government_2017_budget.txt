[9:0:58,372] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:58,399] 6500 - STANDARDS 

[11:0:58,417] The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also 

[11:1:58,426] provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and 

[11:2:58,435] counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices. 

[12:0:58,453] The Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures and 

[12:1:58,462] program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement agencies. 

[12:2:58,471] It also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a clearinghouse of 

[12:3:58,480] successful program information. Finally, it conducts accreditation and peace officer feasibility studies. 

[12:4:58,498] 6505 - TRAINING 

[13:0:58,516] The Training Program increases the competence of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that 

[13:1:58,525] meet identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses, and assisting law 

[13:2:58,534] enforcement agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission 

[13:3:58,543] assesses training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of 

[13:4:58,552] topics necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training 

[13:5:58,561] needs of law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Program also presents advanced 

[13:6:58,570] training for law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership 

[13:7:58,579] Institute, and for trainers through the Basic Academy Instructor Certificate Program and the Instructor Development Institute. 

[13:8:58,588] Other specialty programs include the Institute of Criminal Investigation. 

[14:0:58,606] Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are 

[14:1:58,615] enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards. 

[14:2:58,633] 6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING 

[15:0:58,651] The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs 

[15:1:58,660] associated with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses 

[15:2:58,669] associated with training presentations and for necessary overtime to enable line officers to receive in-service training in 

[15:3:58,678] areas of critical need. To encourage and assist local law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in 

[15:4:58,687] the selection and training of law enforcement officers, the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, 

[15:5:58,696] approximately 346 cities, and numerous specialized districts and local agencies which have agreed to meet the 

[15:6:58,705] Commission's standards.

[11:0:181,467] 8420 State Compensation Insurance Fund 

[11:1:58,487] State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was 

[11:2:58,496] originally enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing 

[11:3:58,505] body of a private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of 

[11:4:58,514] directors for approval. 

[12:0:58,532] State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore 

[12:1:58,541] injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers 

[12:2:58,550] located in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on 

[12:3:58,559] policies written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, 

[12:4:58,568] and the State is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the 

[12:5:58,577] California civil service process and are actually employees of the State. 

[13:0:58,595] State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the State and 

[13:1:58,604] because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not 

[13:2:58,613] financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund. 

[14:0:58,631] Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation 

[14:1:58,640] coverage and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to 

[14:2:58,649] private employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers' 

[14:3:58,658] compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and 

[14:4:58,667] other subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the State provides a 

[14:5:58,676] deposit out of which State Fund pays compensation benefits to injured State workers and medical benefits to health 

[14:6:58,685] providers, and State Fund is reimbursed by state agencies for benefit amounts paid plus a service fee equal to the cost of 

[14:7:58,694] these services. 

[15:0:58,712] For informational purposes only, the following table provides summary data on actual and estimated workers' compensation 

[15:1:58,721] claims costs paid by state agencies. All workers' compensation costs are included in the individual budgets of the 

[16:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[10:3:58,573] science, with a commitment to environmental stewardship. 

[11:0:58,591] The goals of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are to: 

[12:0:58,607] •

[1:0:147,44] 8570 Department of Food and Agriculture - Continued 

[2:0:58,95] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,123] 6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES 

[3:1:58,141] The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and 

[3:2:58,150] diseases to California and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat products exempt from Federal inspection. 

[3:3:58,159] In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic 

[3:4:58,168] financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, (3) have severe negative impact on the 

[3:5:58,177] environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the consumer. 

[3:6:58,195] 6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES 

[4:0:58,213] California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The 

[4:1:58,222] objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural 

[4:2:58,231] commodities, promote consumer protection, food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported grading 

[4:3:58,240] services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the 

[4:4:58,249] marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products. 

[4:5:58,267] This program also provides licenses to eligible California cannabis cultivators and maintains a statewide cannabis tracking 

[4:6:58,276] system. 

[5:0:58,294] This program also provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the 

[5:1:58,303] environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants such as pesticides in food, animal feed and fertilizers. 

[5:2:58,321] 6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 

[5:3:58,339] This program provides limited fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs. 

[5:4:58,357] The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California 

[5:5:58,366] State Fair (an independent state agency). State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and 

[5:6:58,375] periodic financial reviews and audits. 

[5:7:58,393] 6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 

[6:0:58,420] This program provides the fiscal and policy oversight of the federal grants awarded that promote California agriculture, and 

[6:1:58,429] for all CDFA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program activities which are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 

[6:2:58,438] agriculture. 

[7:0:58,456] In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources, 

[7:1:58,465] provides industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized 

[7:2:58,474] communications to California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide 

[7:3:58,483] fairgrounds. 

[8:0:58,501] This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs 

[8:1:58,510] authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA. 

[8:2:58,528] 9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES 

[9:0:58,546] Executive and Management Services include the executive leadership of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office sets 

[9:1:58,555] priorities and policies to protect, support, and promote agriculture in the State of California, and helps to protect the health 

[9:2:58,564] and welfare of the public and the environment. 

[10:0:58,582] Administrative Services provides centralized administrative support to the Department through fiscal operations, employee-

[10:1:58,591] employer relations, personnel management, employee development, and general business services.

[12:1:58,570] The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) regulates critical and essential services such as privately-owned 

[12:2:58,579] telecommunications, electric, natural gas, and water companies, in addition to overseeing railroad/rail transit and moving 

[12:3:58,588] and transportation companies. The PUC is the only agency in the state charged with protecting private utility consumers. As 

[12:4:58,597] such, the PUC is responsible for ensuring that customers have safe, reliable utility service at reasonable rates, protecting 

[12:5:58,606] against fraud, and promoting the health of California's economy, which depends on the infrastructure the utilities and the 

[12:6:58,615] PUC provide.

[14:0:58,490] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[15:0:58,518] 6680 - REGULATION OF UTILITIES 

[16:0:58,536] Californians spend more than $50 billion annually for services from industries regulated by the PUC. This includes 6 

[16:1:58,545] electricity utilities (70 percent of electric load in California), 941 telecommunications carriers, 120 water and sewer utilities, 5 

[16:2:58,554] natural gas utilities with approximately 10.8 million customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home 

[16:3:58,563] park and propane operators. 

[17:0:58,581] The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions 

[17:1:58,590] include both backward-looking investigation and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk 

[17:2:58,599] assessment to identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC also performs operation and maintenance audits, outage 

[17:3:58,608] inspections, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities. 

[18:0:58,626] The PUC conducts triennial reviews of utility operations to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. The 

[18:1:58,635] PUC provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities and other load-serving entities to follow when purchasing electricity on 

[18:2:58,644] behalf of their 11.8 million customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and where needed in 

[18:3:58,653] the state. Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation and promotion of 

[18:4:58,662] ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, the state's mandated renewable energy programs, and other clean energy 

[18:5:58,671] programs. 

[19:0:58,689] Natural gas rate regulation encompasses setting natural gas rates and overseeing services, including in-state transportation 

[19:1:58,698] over the utilities' transmission and distribution pipeline systems, storage, procurement, metering, and billing. 

[19:2:58,716] The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate 

[19:3:58,725] discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost 

[20:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:58,73] weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria. 

[3:0:58,91] The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for 

[3:1:58,100] transmission, telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects. 

[4:0:58,118] The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including 

[4:1:58,127] removing barriers to a fully competitive market; enforcing customer service standards for telecommunication services; 

[4:2:58,136] regulating basic and rural telecommunication rates; protecting consumers against telecommunications fraud; promoting 

[4:3:58,145] widespread access to advanced video technology, and developing programs to bridge the "digital divide." 

[5:0:58,163] The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to 

[5:1:58,172] their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality, 

[5:2:58,181] promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change 

[5:3:58,190] requests, and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements. 

[6:0:58,208] The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in 

[6:1:58,217] participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in 

[6:2:58,226] proceedings. The Consumer Affairs Branch responds to questions regarding utility service and bills, and assists consumers 

[6:3:58,235] who have unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. A Supplier Diversity program promotes 

[6:4:58,244] and monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse. 

[7:0:58,262] 6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELEPHONE PROGRAMS 

[8:0:58,280] The PUC oversees approximately $850 million in telecommunications programs including the California Lifeline Fund, 

[8:1:58,289] California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, and California High Cost Funds, all of which 

[8:2:58,298] provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these "universal telephone service" programs 

[8:3:58,307] include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) encouraging consumer choice among 

[8:4:58,316] competitive telephone companies; (3) modifying, as necessary, the basic telephone service definition to incorporate new 

[8:5:58,325] technology; and (4) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make informed choices about basic service 

[8:6:58,334] and universal lifeline telephone services. The California Teleconnect Fund program provides discounted telecommunication 

[8:7:58,343] services to qualifying schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The California Advanced Services 

[8:8:58,352] Fund Program encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved rural and urban areas 

[8:9:58,361] of California. 

[9:0:58,379] 6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 

[10:0:58,397] The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in 

[10:1:58,406] California. All railroads, 7 major rail transit agencies, 6 smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private 

[10:2:58,415] crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-

[10:3:58,424] certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and 

[10:4:58,433] appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of 

[10:5:58,442] hazardous materials by rail. 

[11:0:58,460] For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train 

[11:1:58,469] control, and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or 

[11:2:58,478] disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, and crossing safety treatments deployed at each 

[11:3:58,487] crossing. Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing 

[11:4:58,496] hazard elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-

[11:5:58,505] separating highway/rail crossings. 

[12:0:58,523] The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation 

[12:1:58,532] companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, and charter and scheduled bus operators), privately-owned water ferries, and 

[12:2:58,541] household goods carriers. The program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety 

[12:3:58,550] standards and insurance requirements, and protects consumers from moving companies and for-hire passenger carriers 

[12:4:58,559] operating illegally. 

[13:0:58,577] 6695 - OFFICE OF RATEPAYER ADVOCATES 

[14:0:58,595] The mandate and function of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The 

[14:1:58,604] ORA is a statutorily-defined state entity charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility customers and 

[14:2:58,613] subscribers in all significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction. 

[15:0:58,631] Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the ORA with a director appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the 

[15:1:58,640] Governor and charged the ORA with representing ratepayer interests in Commission proceedings. Chapter 1005, Statutes of 

[15:2:58,649] 1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement Account to be transferred in 

[15:3:58,658] the annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account. The law further required that "funds 

[15:4:58,667] in the Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account shall be utilized exclusively by the division in the 

[15:5:58,676] performance of its duties as determined by the director" [of ORA], and that the budget be submitted to the Commission for 

[15:6:58,685] approval.  

[16:0:58,703] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that ORA only represent ratepayers in PUC proceedings. SB 

[16:1:58,712] 201 extended ORA's representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the Energy Commission, Air Resources 

[16:2:58,721] Board, California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.

[1:0:171,44] 8660 Public Utilities Commission - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] Chapter 440, Statutes of 2005 (SB 608), required the PUC to provide personnel and resources to ORA, including attorneys 

[2:1:58,91] and other legal support, sufficient to ensure that customer and subscriber interests are effectively represented in all 

[2:2:58,100] significant proceedings. The law also authorized the ORA director to appoint a lead attorney to represent the division and 

[2:3:58,109] that "all attorneys assigned by the Commission to perform services for the division shall report to and be directed by the lead 

[2:4:58,118] attorney appointed by the Director" [of ORA]. 

[3:0:58,136] Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013 (SB 96), requires the creation of an independent ORA program budget administered and 

[3:1:58,145] utilized exclusively by ORA, subject to review and approval by the Department of Finance. SB 96 also requires the ORA 

[3:2:58,154] director to employ personnel and resources, including attorneys and other legal support staff, at a level sufficient to ensure 

[3:3:58,163] that customer and subscriber interests are effectively represented in all significant proceedings.

[4:2:58,224] The Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (Commission) is 

[4:3:58,233] the state's only independent and citizen-based oversight mechanism. It conducts four to five comprehensive reviews of 

[4:4:58,242] executive branch programs, departments, and agencies each year and recommends ways to improve performance by 

[4:5:58,251] increasing efficiency and effectiveness with existing resources. The Commission is statutorily responsible for analyzing and 

[4:6:58,260] making recommendations to the Legislature on all Governor reorganization plans. 

[4:7:58,278] The Commission is composed of two members of the Senate, two members of the Assembly, and nine unpaid citizen 

[4:8:58,287] members - five appointed by the Governor and four appointed by the Legislature. 

[4:9:58,305] Because of the Commission's independence, the Legislature charged it with oversight of the California State Auditor, 

[4:10:58,314] including contracting with an independent auditor for annually examining the State Audit Fund.

[1:1:58,64] The California Law Revision Commission (Commission) has the responsibility to make a continuing substantive review of 

[1:2:58,73] California statutory and decisional law, to recommend legislation to make needed reforms, and to make recommendations to 

[1:3:58,82] the Governor and Legislature for revision of the law on major topics (as assigned by the Legislature) that require detailed 

[1:4:58,91] study and cannot easily be handled in the ordinary legislative process. 

[2:0:58,109] The Commission consists of seven gubernatorial appointees plus one Senator, one Assembly Member, and the Legislative 

[2:1:58,118] Counsel. The Commission's work is independent, nonpartisan, and objective.

[12:0:195,612] 8855 California State Auditor's Office 

[12:1:58,633] The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public 

[12:2:58,642] funds and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of 

[12:3:58,651] state and local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants 

[12:4:58,660] the State Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-

[12:5:58,669] created entity. The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute 

[12:6:58,678] or requested by the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is 

[12:7:58,687] responsible for annually conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the 

[13:0:58,696] State's basic financial statements and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The 

[13:1:58,705] Single Audit is federally required as a condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the 

[13:2:58,714] Legislature enacted a program that requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial 

[13:3:58,723] courts in 2012-13 and thereafter biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five

[2:0:58,73] judicial branch entities - which includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. 

[2:1:58,91] The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, 

[2:2:58,100] abuse, and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the 

[2:3:58,109] authority to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk 

[2:4:58,118] program, Chapter 451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to 

[2:5:58,127] identify local government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high 

[2:6:58,136] risk for the potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their 

[2:7:58,145] economy, efficiency, or effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local 

[2:8:58,154] entities. 

[3:0:58,172] Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform 

[3:1:58,181] independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. 

[3:2:58,190] The State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of 

[3:3:58,199] improper acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law. 

[3:4:58,217] The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an 

[3:5:58,226] application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10 

[3:6:58,235] years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and 

[3:7:58,244] conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

[11:0:58,388] 6770 - STATE BUDGET 

[12:0:58,406] To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance 

[12:1:58,415] advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's 

[12:2:58,424] Budget contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and 

[12:3:58,433] proposed expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of 

[12:4:58,442] Finance assists in the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state 

[12:5:58,451] agencies and programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within 

[12:6:58,460] existing resources, and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the 

[12:7:58,469] Governor. Basic and applied economic and tax research functions support the revenue estimates required for the 

[12:8:58,478] development of the state financial plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the evaluation of economic trends or 

[12:9:58,487] other fiscal developments which affect the state. Basic and applied demographic research functions provide data to support 

[12:10:58,496] the workload estimates of state agencies. 

[13:0:58,514] 6775 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA (FI$Cal) PROJECT SUPPORT 

[14:0:58,532] The Department of Finance is one of four partner agencies responsible for the development, implementation, utilization, and 

[14:1:58,541] maintenance of an integrated statewide financial management system, FI$Cal. This program includes Department of 

[14:2:58,550] Finance subject-matter experts assigned to the FI$Cal Project. 

[15:0:58,568] 6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS 

[16:0:58,586] The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs. The Office of 

[16:1:58,595] State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all 

[16:2:58,604] matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical 

[16:3:58,613] examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of 

[16:4:58,622] redevelopment agencies. Effective July 1, 2017, Program 6800 (Local Government Audits and Evaluations) merged with 

[16:5:58,631] Program 6780. 

[17:0:58,649] 6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING 

[18:0:58,667] The Statewide Accounting Policies, Consulting and Training Unit sets statewide accounting policies and procedures. The 

[18:1:58,676] unit provides fiscal consulting, training, and support services to departments to help ensure that the state's assets are 

[18:2:58,685] protected and accurate, and timely financial information is maintained. The unit maintains a uniform and complete 

[18:3:58,694] accounting system for state departments and participates in the development of other statewide financial systems.

[10:6:58,649] families and to the community. With an authorized strength of 22,325, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are 

[10:7:58,658] organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance. 

[10:8:58,676] The Military Department Youth and Community Program serves California communities and families by delivering national 

[10:9:58,685] level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic 

[10:10:58,694] structured environment. In addition to the funding that flows through the State Treasury, the Military Department also 

[10:11:58,703] receives federal funding directly from the Department of Defense. A special display titled "Other Federal Funds" shows the 

[10:12:58,712] funding received from this source.

[1:0:194,44] 8940 Military Department - Continued 

[2:0:58,82] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:0:58,109] 6911 - NATIONAL GUARD 

[4:0:58,127] The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our 

[4:1:58,136] State Military Reserve. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, 

[5:0:58,145] communications, law enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air 

[5:1:58,154] defense, airlift and unmanned aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The 

[5:2:58,163] Office of the Adjutant General element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such 

[5:3:58,172] as personnel and fiscal resource management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information 

[6:0:58,181] technology. The Military Civil Support element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so 

[6:1:58,190] that mutual understanding and unity of purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, 

[6:2:58,199] prepare, and train for the deployment of Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called 

[6:3:58,208] to state service by the Governor due to domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and 

[6:4:58,217] other public agencies with the coordination necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Military Reserve is 

[6:5:58,226] a volunteer component of the Military Department whose mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during 

[6:6:58,235] training, preparation for mobilization, demobilization, and provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state 

[6:7:58,244] emergencies. The federal government provides virtually all supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support 

[6:8:58,253] services necessary for training, deployment, and commitment of the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance 

[6:9:58,262] with the Department of the Army and Air Force Regulations and Training Guidance. 

[7:0:58,280] 6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS 

[8:0:58,298] The Military Department manages the following seven programs while serving more than 12,000 youth annually: California 

[8:1:58,307] Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, 

[8:2:58,316] STARBASE Academy Sacramento and STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 

[8:3:58,325] by the California Legislature and then-Adjutant General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program 

[8:4:58,334] that is designed to provide maximum growth and leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school 

[8:5:58,343] levels. It provides leadership opportunities for cadets by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as 

[8:6:58,352] leaders in their cadet military units, and by demonstrating proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their 

[8:7:58,361] communities. As part of their training, cadets provide assistance and support to the school and community. The Oakland 

[8:8:58,370] Military Institute College Preparatory Academy develops leaders of character by providing a rigorous seven-year college 

[8:9:58,379] preparatory program to promote excellence in the four pillars of academics, leadership, citizenship, and athletics. Using a 

[8:10:58,388] military framework, the goal of Oakland Military Institute is to graduate cadets who are capable of meeting the admissions 

[8:11:58,397] requirements for any college in the nation and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The mission of the National 

[8:12:58,406] Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 16-18 year old high school dropouts. Graduates 

[8:13:58,415] leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens. The 

[8:14:58,424] goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school students, primarily 5th graders, to 

[8:15:58,433] explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their education. The curriculum is designed to 

[8:16:58,442] increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of the role that STEM literacy plays in their 

[8:17:58,451] lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities more attractive and accessible. While 

[8:18:58,460] attending STARBASE students interact with military personnel to explore careers and observe STEM applications in the 

[8:19:58,469] "real world." These seven youth programs are financed with federal, state and local funds. The California National Guard is 

[8:20:58,478] involved in youth programs because political and community leaders at the federal, state, and local levels recognize that the 

[8:21:58,487] National Guard brings structure, discipline, and effective leadership training methods to the educational setting.

[11:1:58,626] The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) promotes and delivers innovative services that California veterans 

[11:2:58,635] and their families need for successful, productive, efficient and cost-effective collaboration with its key stakeholders and 

[11:3:58,644] partners. The CalVet seeks to serve California's veterans and their families. 

[11:4:58,662] More specifically, the CalVet: 

[12:0:58,678] • 

[12:1:58,696] • 

[12:2:58,705] • 

[13:0:68,680] Provides California veterans and their families with aid and assistance in presenting their claims for veterans' benefits 

[13:1:68,689] under the laws of the United States. 

[14:0:68,698] Provides California veterans with beneficial opportunities through direct low-cost loans to acquire farms and homes. 

[14:1:68,707] Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a home-

[14:2:68,716] like environment at the California Veterans Homes.

[1:0:162,44] 8955 Department of Veterans Affairs - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public 

[2:1:58,82] purposes by promoting patriotism, by recognizing and rewarding sacrifice and service to country, and by providing needed 

[2:2:58,91] readjustment assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to their 

[2:3:58,100] country's call to military service. 

[3:0:58,118] Because the CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, it has a capital outlay program to support this 

[3:1:58,127] need. For the specifics on the CalVet's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[16:0:58,650] 7500 - HOMEOWNERS' PROPERTY TAX RELIEF 

[17:0:58,668] In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying 

[17:1:58,677] property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the 

[17:2:58,686] state to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption. 

[17:3:58,704] 7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE 

[18:0:58,722] The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural, 

[19:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[2:0:58,73] scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, Section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to 

[2:1:58,82] be assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties 

[2:2:58,91] to partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program. 

[2:3:58,109] 7510 - SENIOR CITIZENS' PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT LOAN REPAYMENTS 

[3:0:58,127] The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program allows eligible homeowners to defer payment of residential 

[3:1:58,136] property tax. The state pays the deferred taxes to local governments on behalf of the participants, and places a lien on their 

[3:2:58,145] property to assure repayment when the property is sold or transferred. The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement 

[3:3:58,154] Loan Repayments Program captures repayments from individuals that participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax 

[3:4:58,163] Postponement Program and transfers to the General Fund the amount in excess of what is required to fund the 

[3:5:58,172] Postponement Program claims. The Program was suspended in 2009 and was reestablished via legislation in 2014 (Chapter 

[3:6:58,181] 703, Statutes of 2014).  

[4:0:58,199] 7520 - LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESS PROGRAM 

[5:0:58,217] The Local Update of Census Address Program provides population-based incentive grants of between $7,500 and $125,000 

[5:1:58,226] to cities and counties, to ensure they participate in the review and update of the United States Census Bureau's Master

[1:2:58,73] appropriates $1,000 and authorizes the Director of Finance to allocate up to $200 million General Fund if tobacco settlement

[17:1:58,685] The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash 

[17:2:58,694] flow and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow 

[17:3:58,703] imbalances during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the 

[17:4:58,712] General Fund may need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. This short-term borrowing for cash flow purposes 

[17:5:58,721] does not indicate fiscal weakness and may be preferable to carrying too large a General Fund reserve. Budgetary loans

[17:0:58,543] 7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT 

[18:0:58,561] Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities 

[19:0:58,579] Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to 

[19:1:58,588] as "borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in 

[19:2:58,597] slightly modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables 

[19:3:58,606] the General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these 

[19:4:58,615] funds' money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not 

[19:5:58,624] interfere with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a 

[19:6:58,633] fund is designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State 

[19:7:58,642] Controller's Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund 

[19:8:58,651] cash shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire 

[19:9:58,660] cash balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes. 

[20:0:58,678] A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79, 

[20:1:58,687] Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state 

[20:2:58,696] entity that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 

[20:3:58,705] million and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in 

[20:4:58,714] this program. 

[21:0:58,745] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details. 


# === PAGE 183 === [size: 612x792]
[0:0:58,15] GENERAL GOVERNMENT   2017-18 STATE BUDGET — GG 181 

[1:0:134,44] 9620 Cash Management and Budgetary Loans - Continued 

[2:0:58,73] A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, 

[2:1:58,82] Government Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing 

[2:2:58,91] additional liquidity for the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the 

[2:3:58,100] maximum amount for the VIP from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this program. 

[3:0:58,127] Borrowing From Financial Markets 

[4:0:58,145] In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this 

[4:1:58,154] doctrine, an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 

[4:2:58,163] 1 of Article XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This 

[4:3:58,172] doctrine was invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and 

[4:4:58,181] again in 1971 to validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions 

[4:5:58,190] were invoked in 1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like 

[4:6:58,199] registered warrants, required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes 

[4:7:58,208] provisions were re-enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84. 

[5:0:58,226] In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided 

[5:1:58,235] the flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external 

[5:2:58,244] funds results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which 

[5:3:58,253] the General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. 

[5:4:58,271] External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation 

[5:5:58,280] warrants (RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in 

[5:6:58,289] anticipation of receiving revenues in the near future. 

[6:0:58,307] Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any 

[6:1:58,316] other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow. 

[7:0:58,343] Overall Program 

[8:0:58,361] Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for 

[8:1:58,370] the past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts 

[8:2:58,379] nor disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. In order to reflect cash flow, 

[8:3:58,388] budget data is converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the 

[8:4:58,397] Controller and for accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and 

[8:5:58,406] administrative actions. 

[9:0:58,424] The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and 

[9:1:58,433] assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used 

[9:2:58,442] from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year. 

[9:3:58,460] 7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS 

[10:0:58,478] The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are being 

[10:1:58,487] repaid over multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are being repaid with interest calculated at 

[10:2:58,496] the Pooled Money Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

[8:3:58,428] between the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely 

[8:4:58,437] fund disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds 

[8:5:58,446] in the state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal 

[8:6:58,455] government from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state 

[8:7:58,464] account; and (d) the federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the 

[8:8:58,473] state account until the funds are paid out for program purposes. 

[9:0:58,491] The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $273 million or more in federal fund 

[9:1:58,500] expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e., 

[9:2:58,509] check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be 

[9:3:58,518] deposited before the warrants are issued. 

[10:0:58,536] Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest 

[10:1:58,545] liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

[0:0:58,15] 2017-18 STATE BUDGET — GG 184   GENERAL GOVERNMENT 

[1:0:167,44] 9650 Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants 

[2:0:58,64] This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents. 

[2:1:58,82] The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health 

[2:2:58,91] plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was 

[2:3:58,100] added in 1982. 

[3:0:58,118] The 2016-17 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula 

[3:1:58,127] established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested members. Under this formula, the state averages the 

[3:2:58,136] premiums of the four largest health benefit plans in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards 

[3:3:58,145] retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the 

[3:4:58,154] retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract. 

[3:5:58,172] The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are 

[3:6:58,181] determined on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2016 monthly 

[3:7:58,190] contribution maximums are $705 for a single enrollee, $1,343 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee 

[3:8:58,199] and two or more dependents. The 2017 monthly contribution maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an 

[3:9:58,208] enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan 

[3:10:58,217] and number of dependents. 

[4:0:58,235] Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code 

[4:1:58,244] 6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

[5:0:202,209] 9658 Budget Stabilization Account 

[5:1:58,230] Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization 

[5:2:58,239] Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. 

[6:0:58,257] Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers 

[6:1:58,266] between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a 

[6:2:58,275] calculated amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities. 

[6:3:58,293] Prior to passage of Proposition 2, Proposition 58, as approved by the voters in March 2004, established the BSA, and 

[6:4:58,302] required the State Controller to transfer a specified percentage of estimated General Fund revenues from the General Fund 

[6:5:58,311] to the BSA. The Legislature could transfer, by statute, amounts in excess of the specified percentage to the BSA. In 

[6:6:58,320] addition, the Governor, by executive order, could suspend the transfer to the BSA. Half of the funds transferred to the BSA 

[6:7:58,329] were used to retire Economic Recovery Bonds authorized in Proposition 57 (March 2004). Proposition 2 strengthened the 

[6:8:58,338] reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the 

[6:9:58,347] BSA, and increasing the reserve limit. 

[7:0:58,373] LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 

[7:1:58,392] PROGRAM AUTHORITY 

[8:0:58,410] Section 20, Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California. 

[8:1:58,428] Control Section 35.50, Budget Act. 

[9:0:58,468] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[10:0:58,495] 7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy 

[10:1:58,504] day" 50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital 

[10:2:58,513] gains over 8 percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 

[10:3:58,522] percent to pay down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy 

[10:4:58,531] day," reduced by any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance 

[10:5:58,540] in the BSA is limited to 10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes. Any amounts in excess of ten percent will be used 

[10:6:58,549] for specified infrastructure needs. 

[11:0:58,567] Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years, if applicable. 

[12:0:58,585] The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds 

[12:1:58,594] from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for 

[12:2:58,603] appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year. 

[13:0:58,621] Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will 

[13:1:58,630] smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum 

[13:2:58,639] guarantee calculation and transfers will not occur until various operational and economic conditions are met.

[3:1:58,224] The federal courts periodically issue judgments or "writs of execution" against the State of California requiring the state to 

[3:2:58,233] make payments to the federal government. The writs and judgments provide the authority to the federal government to 

[3:3:58,242] withdraw funds from the state bank accounts maintained by the State Treasurer's Office at the various state depository 

[3:4:58,251] banks. 

[4:0:58,269] Each year, the Budget Act authorizes the Department of Finance to identify specific appropriations or funds to charge when 

[4:1:58,278] the federal government withdraws funds from state bank accounts. When no specific appropriation or fund can be 

[4:2:58,287] identified, the withdrawals are charged to the unappropriated General Fund balance. 

[5:0:58,305] No levies were paid during the 2015-16 fiscal year and none have been paid through June 15, 2017.

[15:0:166,585] 9885 Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances 

[15:1:58,605] For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not 

[15:2:58,614] yet been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure 

[15:3:58,623] totals. This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department 

[15:4:58,632] budgets. 

[16:0:58,650] For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that 

[17:0:58,659] encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore, 

[17:1:58,668] Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General 

[17:2:58,677] Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and 

[17:3:58,686] state policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide 

[17:4:58,695] adjustment to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government 

[17:5:58,704] Code Section 13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary 

[17:6:58,713] Schedule 1 for the General Fund.

[2:0:58,82] COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT 

[3:0:58,100] The State Controller's Office accumulated a preliminary estimated General Fund encumbrance total of $979,901,000 from 

[3:1:58,109] 2015-16 year-end financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are 

[3:2:58,118] estimated to be at the same level for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within 

[3:3:58,127] the next fiscal year. The Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the

[1:0:120,58] 9900 Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata) 

[1:1:58,78] Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide 

[1:2:58,87] budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments. The Pro Rata process 

[2:0:58,96] apportions the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit 

[2:1:58,105] from the services. Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are 

[2:2:58,114] transferred from the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund.  

[3:0:58,132] Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata charges to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets. This 

[3:1:58,141] budget item included Pro Rata costs directly charged to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not 

[3:2:58,150] provided for in departmental budgets. Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata costs charged directly at the 

[3:3:58,159] fund level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
