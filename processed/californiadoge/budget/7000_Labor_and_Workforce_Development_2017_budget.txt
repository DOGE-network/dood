[3:0:352,449] The Labor and Workforce Development Agency 

[3:1:352,458] was established to address issues relating to 

[3:2:352,467] California workers and their employers. The 

[4:0:352,476] Agency is responsible for labor law enforcement, 

[4:1:352,485] workforce development, and benefit payment 

[4:2:352,494] and adjudication. The Agency works to combat 

[4:3:352,503] the underground economy and help legitimate 

[4:4:352,512] businesses and workers in California through a 

[4:5:352,521] combination of enforcement and education 

[4:6:352,530] activities.

[1:0:175,44] 7100 Employment Development Department 

[1:1:58,64] The Employment Development Department (EDD) enhances California's economic growth and prosperity by collaboratively 

[1:2:58,73] delivering valuable and innovative services to meet the evolving needs of employers, workers, and job seekers. The EDD 

[1:3:58,82] connects employers with job seekers, administers the Unemployment Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Paid Family 

[1:4:58,91] Leave programs, and provides employment and training programs under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 

[1:5:58,100] Act. Additionally, the EDD collects various employment payroll taxes including the personal income tax, and collects and 

[1:6:58,109] provides comprehensive economic, occupational, and socio-demographic labor market information concerning California's 

[1:7:58,118] workforce. 

[2:0:58,136] Because the EDD's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to 

[2:1:58,145] support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[18:0:58,589] 6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS 

[19:0:58,607] This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group 

[19:1:58,616] of employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is 

[19:2:58,625] actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program also ensures that each self-insured 

[19:3:58,634] private-sector employer posts a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the 

[19:4:58,643] employer defaults on its obligations. 

[19:5:58,661] 6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION 

[20:0:58,679] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize 

[20:1:58,688] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides 

[20:2:58,697] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation 

[20:3:58,706] benefits. The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators to ensure compliance with the benefit 

[20:4:58,715] delivery system required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers 

[20:5:58,724] from the Uninsured Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes

[3:1:58,91] of the benefit delivery system. 

[4:0:58,109] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers' 

[4:1:58,118] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the 

[4:2:58,127] court, and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.

[8:1:58,280] workers on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels 

[8:2:58,289] for the benefit of the general public. These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of 

[8:3:58,298] Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the 

[8:4:58,307] Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board). 

[9:0:58,325] DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and 

[9:1:58,334] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to 

[9:2:58,343] operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels. The 

[9:3:58,352] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these 

[9:4:58,361] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety 

[9:5:58,370] records, reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and 

[9:6:58,379] provides accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made 

[9:7:58,388] by state and local government. 

[10:0:58,406] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as

[10:2:58,424] labor, one member from the field of occupational health, and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole 

[10:3:58,433] agency in the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety 

[10:4:58,442] standards enforced by DOSH. 

[11:0:58,460] The Cal/OSHA Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of 

[11:1:58,469] citations and accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by DOSH for violations of occupational safety and health 

[11:2:58,478] standards. It is comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, 

[11:3:58,487] one member from the field of management, and one member from the field of labor.

[2:0:58,73] The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California. This includes initial program approval and subsequent 

[2:1:58,82] oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs 

[2:2:58,91] and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. 

[3:0:58,109] The California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the 

[3:1:58,118] general policy under which this program operates. 

[3:2:58,136] 6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES 

[4:0:58,154] The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers' 

[4:1:58,163] compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required 

[4:2:58,172] under the Labor Code. 

[5:0:58,190] The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor 

[5:1:58,199] Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be 

[5:2:58,208] disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
