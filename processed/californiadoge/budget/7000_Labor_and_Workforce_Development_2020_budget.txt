[6:1:66,446] match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an internet labor exchange system to facilitate  

[6:2:66,456] this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to  

[6:3:66,466] provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans,  

[6:4:66,476] youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited  

[6:5:66,487] locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable employment.

[7:1:66,535] impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax  

[7:2:66,545] liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one  

[7:3:66,555] each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly.  

[8:0:66,576] The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the  

[8:1:66,586] Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit  

[8:2:66,596] programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction.  

[8:3:66,614] 5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,634] The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California  

[9:1:66,644] workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income  

[9:2:66,655] replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  

[9:3:66,672] 5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,690] The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing  

[10:1:66,700] monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take

[3:2:66,111] 5930 - TAX PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,128] The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax  

[4:1:66,139] collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support  

[4:2:66,149] the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs.  

[4:3:66,167] 5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL  

[5:0:66,184] The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including  

[5:1:66,194] small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages  

[5:2:66,205] and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention  

[5:3:66,215] and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes  

[5:4:66,225] special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout  

[5:5:66,235] the state.  

[6:0:66,253] 5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  

[7:0:66,273] The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment  

[7:1:66,284] Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide  

[7:2:66,294] and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California in local  

[7:3:66,304] communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce,  

[7:4:66,314] veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to  

[7:5:66,324] job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention,  

[7:6:66,335] earnings, and occupational skills of participants.  

[7:7:66,352] 5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS  

[8:0:66,373] The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as the National Emergency Grant Program,  

[8:1:66,383] consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due  

[8:2:66,393] to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to

[11:4:66,603] the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial   courts.  

[12:0:66,623] The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to:  

[12:1:65,641] • Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively  

[12:2:76,651] represent them in their labor relations with their employer.  

[13:0:65,668] • Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees,  

[13:1:76,678] and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws.  

[13:2:65,694] • Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings.  

[13:3:65,710] • Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it

[4:3:66,134] sector employer posts a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer  

[4:4:66,144] defaults on its obligations.  

[5:0:66,162] 6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[6:0:66,179] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize  

[6:1:66,190] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides  

[6:2:66,200] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits.  

[6:3:66,210] The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system  

[6:4:66,220] required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured  

[6:5:66,230] Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and  

[6:6:66,241] sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system  

[6:7:66,251] designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system.  

[6:8:66,261] Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical  

[6:9:66,271] Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-

[6:10:66,281] based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by  

[6:11:66,292] identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system.  

[7:0:66,309] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'  

[8:0:66,320] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court,  

[8:1:66,330] and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.  

[9:0:66,347] 6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[10:0:66,365] The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for: (1) issuing an annual report on the state  

[10:1:66,375] of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications which would  

[10:2:66,386] improve the operation of the system; (2) conducting specified surveys and evaluations required by law; (3) conducting  

[10:3:66,396] continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and  

[10:4:66,406] occupational diseases, including making recommendations on how to improve the workers' compensation and health and  

[10:5:66,416] safety program, and if it deems appropriate, conducting or contracting for studies necessary to carry out its responsibilities; (4)

[11:0:66,464] 6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  

[12:0:66,482] The objectives of this program include the promotion and enforcement of measures to protect the health and safety of workers  

[12:1:66,492] on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels for the  

[12:2:66,503] benefit of the general public. These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of Occupational  

[12:3:66,513] Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational  

[12:4:66,523] Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board).  

[13:0:66,541] DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and  

[13:1:66,551] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to  

[13:2:66,561] operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels. The  

[13:3:66,571] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these  

[13:4:66,581] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety records,  

[13:5:66,592] reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and provides  

[13:6:66,602] accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by state and  

[13:7:66,612] local government.  

[14:0:66,630] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as  

[14:1:66,640] follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor,  

[14:2:66,650] one member from the field of occupational health, and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in  

[14:3:66,660] the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards  

[14:4:66,671] enforced by DOSH.  

[15:0:66,688] The Cal/OSHA Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations  

[15:1:66,698] and accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by DOSH for violations of occupational safety and health standards. It is

[4:14:66,279] 6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS  

[5:0:66,296] The objectives of this program are to promote, develop, and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs and to  

[5:1:66,307] provide consultation services to program sponsors. The Division's goal is to match the needs of workers with those of  

[5:2:66,317] employers, and to strengthen the apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting  

[5:3:66,327] workers and teaching the skills they and their employers need.  

[6:0:66,345] The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California. This includes initial program approval and subsequent  

[6:1:66,355] oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs  

[6:2:66,365] and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws.
