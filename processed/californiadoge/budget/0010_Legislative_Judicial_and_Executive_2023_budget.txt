[4:0:243,130] 0130   Joint Expenses  

[5:0:66,151] The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and  

[5:1:66,160] establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal  

[5:2:66,170] and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  

[5:3:66,188] Because the Legislature's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to  

[5:4:66,197] support this need.   For the specifics on the Legislature's   capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[17:1:66,681] completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for  

[17:2:66,691] construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.   The Annex, which was  

[17:3:66,700] completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices.

[11:0:66,433] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional  

[11:1:66,442] officers, and legislative statutory officers.  

[12:0:66,462] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of  

[12:1:66,472] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,  

[12:2:66,482] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.   The Legislators'  

[12:3:66,491] Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 

[13:0:66,511] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November  

[13:1:66,521] 6, 1990.   Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340)  

[13:2:66,530] closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory  

[13:3:66,540] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[6:0:208,199] 0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau  

[7:0:66,220] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal services to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members and  

[7:1:66,230] committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The legal  

[7:2:66,239] services furnished include rendering legal opinions, drafting bills and other legislative measures, counseling, attending  

[7:3:66,249] meetings of legislative committees as counsel, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The Bureau also provides legal  

[7:4:66,259] services to the Governor and advises state agencies as to the preparation of legislative measures. An attorney-client  

[7:5:66,269] relationship is maintained and all work is confidential.  

[8:0:66,288] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative  

[8:1:66,298] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes.  

[9:0:66,318] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides technology services to the Legislature, including IT services  

[9:1:66,327] in support of legislative business operations and the legislative information system, which provides information to the public  

[9:2:66,337] regarding pending legislation and existing law.  

[10:0:66,357] Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the  

[10:1:66,366] Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws recommended by the  

[10:2:66,376] National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these uniform acts.  

[10:3:66,393] Pursuant to Chapter 450 of the Statutes of 2018, the Bureau provides advice and investigation services to the Legislature  

[10:4:66,403] related to workplace misconduct through the Workplace Conduct Unit.

[9:0:242,458] 0250   Judicial Branch  

[10:0:66,479] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of  

[10:1:66,489] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.  

[10:2:66,499] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially  

[10:3:66,508] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.  

[11:0:66,528] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent  

[11:1:66,538] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was  

[11:2:66,548] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This  

[12:0:66,557] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The  

[12:1:66,567] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty  

[13:0:66,577] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments  

[13:1:66,587] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted  

[13:2:66,596] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act  

[13:3:66,606] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the  

[13:4:66,616] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial  

[13:5:66,626] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are  

[13:6:66,635] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of  

[13:7:66,645] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities  

[13:8:66,655] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.  

[14:0:66,675] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,  

[14:1:66,684] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United  

[14:2:66,694] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.

[28:0:64,587] 1/ Reflects the 2021-22 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the trial courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for 2021-22. Non-state  

[28:1:64,593] funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[29:0:64,599] 2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees. 

[30:0:64,607] 3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 57 trial courts based on courts' 2022-23 Schedule 1 submissions. Courts have been noted with an asterisk (*) for when Schedule 1 data from 2021-22 is provided.  

[30:1:64,615] 4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.  

[31:0:64,622] 5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in  

[31:1:64,629] the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1. 

[32:0:64,635] 6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in  

[33:0:64,641] Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial  

[33:1:64,646] Courts" (Figure 2) amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for the "State Trial Court Funding Total." 

[34:0:64,652] 7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences. For  

[34:1:64,659] the current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
[35:0:64,665] 8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2021-22 and estimated expenditures for 2022-23 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2022-23 Enacted Budget.

[17:0:34,290] 1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, GF, and JBWCF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state  

[17:1:34,298] operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). Expenditures are rounded to the nearest thousand. 

[17:2:34,311] 2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding,  

[17:3:34,319] Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts"  

[17:4:34,326] amount in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1).  

[18:0:34,339] 3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid, excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" (Figure 1)  

[18:1:34,347] revenue amounts reported ($148.123 million in 2021-22 and $164.241 million in 2022-23).Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by  

[18:2:34,354] the TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2021-22 and 2022-23 participated in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF. 

[19:0:34,369] 4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training  

[19:1:34,377] (DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects the appropriated  

[19:2:34,384] funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program (FFDRP). 

[20:0:34,396] 5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred  

[20:1:34,405] to the JBWCF.

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,84] 0130 - SUPREME COURT  

[4:0:66,103] The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state  

[4:1:66,113] courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the  

[4:2:66,123] Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations  

[4:3:66,133] for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of  

[4:4:66,142] statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the  

[4:5:66,152] Supreme Court.  

[4:6:66,169] 0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL  

[5:0:66,189] Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six  

[5:1:66,199] District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the  

[5:2:66,209] Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law.  

[5:3:66,226] 0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL  

[6:0:66,245] The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21  

[6:1:66,255] voting members and 9 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as the  

[6:2:66,265] administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation of  

[6:3:66,275] the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and  

[6:4:66,284] administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges,  

[6:5:66,294] technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research.

[7:0:66,331] The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of  

[7:1:66,341] judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real  

[7:2:66,351] estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction.  

[7:3:66,368] 0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING  

[8:0:66,385] California has 58 trial courts, one in each county. In trial courts, or superior courts, a judge and sometimes a jury hears  

[8:1:66,395] witnesses' testimony and other evidence and decides cases by applying the relevant law to the facts.   Trial courts have trial  

[8:2:66,405] jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases. To accomplish various statutory mandates, the State Trial Court Funding Program  

[8:3:66,414] supports trial courts through the following programs:  

[8:4:66,434] 0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS  

[9:0:66,451] This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and

[9:2:66,478] 0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL

[11:1:66,594] Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a  

[11:2:66,604] court to avoid case delay.  

[11:3:66,621] 0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS  

[12:0:66,638] This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family and civil proceedings as  

[12:1:66,648] required by statute.

[6:3:66,211] administration of the Civil Representation Pilot Program.  

[7:0:66,228] In addition to the programs mentioned above, the State Trial Court Funding Program supports a number of smaller programs  

[7:1:66,238] including Access to Visitation services in family law proceedings, JusticeCorps volunteers in the courts, and Substance Abuse  

[7:2:66,248] Focus Grants supporting collaborative justice courts.

[8:0:66,285] The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides legal representation for indigent petitioners in death penalty habeas corpus  

[8:1:66,295] proceedings before the California state courts and the federal courts. The Center also serves as a resource center for the  

[8:2:66,304] private capital defense bar, and it   recruits and trains attorneys to expand the pool of private counsel qualified to accept  

[8:3:66,314] appointments in death penalty habeas corpus proceedings,   and thereby helps to reduce the number of unrepresented indigents  

[8:4:66,324] on California's death row.

[5:0:180,246] 0280   Commission on Judicial Performance  

[6:0:66,267] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of  

[6:1:66,277] judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California  

[6:2:66,287] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of  

[6:3:66,297] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or  

[6:4:66,306] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.  

[6:5:66,316] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.  

[7:0:66,336] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial  

[7:1:66,345] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation  

[7:2:66,355] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal  

[7:3:66,365] from office.  

[8:0:66,385] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the  

[8:1:66,394] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,  

[8:2:66,404] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.  

[8:3:66,414] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[10:0:207,507] 0390   Contributions to the Judges  

[11:0:66,528] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and  

[11:1:66,538] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement  

[11:2:66,548] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.  

[12:0:66,565] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in  

[12:1:66,575] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System  

[12:2:66,585] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final  

[12:3:66,594] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement  

[12:4:66,604] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of  

[12:5:66,614] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined  

[12:6:66,624] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II is funded  

[12:7:66,633] through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. The state's contributions are adjusted  

[12:8:66,643] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.  

[13:0:66,663] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,  

[14:0:66,673] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges  

[14:1:66,682] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing  

[14:2:66,692] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit  

[14:3:66,702] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the  

[14:4:66,712] required benefit payments to retired judges.

[7:1:66,216] from travel and tourism. The objective of the Tourism Assessment Program is to identify potentially assessable businesses,  

[7:2:66,226] assist companies with determining the appropriate amount of their self-assessment, and collet the fee.  

[8:0:66,243] 0235028 - CALIFORINIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK  

[9:0:66,260] California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (IBank) was created to finance public infrastructure and private  

[9:1:66,270] development that promote a healthy climate for jobs, contribute to a strong economy and improve the quality of life in California  

[9:2:66,280] communities. IBank has broad authority to participate in a variety of financing transactions, including issuing tax-exempt and  

[9:3:66,289] taxable revenue bonds, providing financing to a variety of entities, providing credit enhancements, acquiring or leasing facilities,

[11:0:66,373] The Small Business Loan Guarantee Program (SBLGP) promotes local economic development by providing guarantees for  

[11:1:66,383] loans issued to small businesses from financial institutions, typically banks, that otherwise would not approve a term loan or  

[11:2:66,392] line of credit to a small business. As a result of the SBLGP, participating small businesses are able to secure financing that  

[11:3:66,402] allows them to grow and expand their business. The loan guarantee serves as a credit enhancement and an incentive for  

[11:4:66,412] financial institutions to make loans to small businesses that otherwise would not be eligible for such financing.

[1:0:414,13] 2023-24 STATE BUDGET — LJE   95 

[2:0:164,32] 0552   Office of the Inspector General - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional  

[3:1:66,78] system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's  

[3:2:66,88] (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, staff complaints, and the employee disciplinary process. The Inspector  

[3:3:66,98] General audits and reviews the policies, practices, and procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's  

[3:4:66,108] candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the  

[3:5:66,117] state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at  

[3:6:66,127] each state prison. OIG receives communications from individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-

[3:7:66,137] free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of  

[3:8:66,147] complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper management where a legally cognizable cause of action is  

[3:9:66,156] present; and reviews sexual abuse incidents within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the  

[3:10:66,166] state correctional system by publicly reporting its findings.  

[4:0:66,183] In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (C-ROB) that examines CDCR's various mental  

[4:1:66,193] health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for incarcerated individuals and parolees. C-ROB meets at  

[4:2:66,203] least twice annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of rehabilitation and treatment programs. C-ROB  

[4:3:66,213] also submits annual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of  

[4:4:66,223] treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of incarcerated individuals and individuals on parole, gaps in rehabilitation services, and  

[4:5:66,232] levels of participation and success.

[7:3:66,265] conserve agriculture lands; strengthen community resilience; promote public health; and advance racial equity. SGC  

[7:4:66,274] administers the following grant programs: Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities; Transformative Climate  

[8:0:66,284] Communities; Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation; Climate Change Research – all of which are part of the California  

[8:1:66,294] Climate Investments Program, funded by proceeds from the State’s cap-and-trade auction revenues. SGC operates these  

[8:2:66,304] funding programs in collaboration with interagency teams to develop program guidelines, review applications, and administer  

[8:3:66,314] program funds. SGC’s Community Assistance for Climate Equity Program encompasses both the Regional Climate

[13:0:66,486] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency  

[13:1:66,496] response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's  

[13:2:66,505] Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's  

[13:3:66,515] homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for,  

[13:4:66,525] protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats.  

[13:5:66,542] Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal  

[13:6:66,552] agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in  

[13:7:66,562] emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own  

[13:8:66,571] resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the  

[13:9:66,581] federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.  

[13:10:66,599] During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's  

[13:11:66,608] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal  

[13:12:66,618] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the  

[13:13:66,628] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes  

[13:14:66,638] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  

[14:0:66,655] Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and  

[14:1:66,665] the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS  

[14:2:66,674] assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of   and response to criminal and terrorist activity and   also facilitates  

[14:3:66,684] information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners.

[3:0:66,68] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety   Commission   is a separate unit within the   Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to  

[3:1:66,78] lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well  

[3:2:66,88] as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management.  

[4:0:66,105] Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this  

[4:1:66,115] need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[3:0:66,65] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:0:66,84] 0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES  

[5:0:66,103] Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program  

[5:1:66,113] coordinates the provision   of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended  

[5:2:66,123] in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-

[5:3:66,133] hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National  

[5:4:66,142] Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this  

[5:5:66,152] program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to  

[5:6:66,162] all hazards.  

[6:0:66,179] 0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,196] Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services  

[7:1:66,206] grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland  

[7:2:66,216] Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency  

[7:3:66,226] management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant  

[7:4:66,236] management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with  

[7:5:66,245] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the  

[7:6:66,255] centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion  

[7:7:66,265] center.  

[8:0:66,282] 0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION  

[9:0:66,299] The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent  

[9:1:66,309] earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s  

[9:2:66,319] progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.   The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate,  

[9:3:66,329] and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.   The  

[9:4:66,339] Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support  

[9:5:66,348] the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.   These activities include: (1) developing and  

[9:6:66,358] reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related  

[9:7:66,368] legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies,  

[9:8:66,378] where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and  

[9:9:66,387] supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery.  

[9:10:66,405] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS  

[10:0:66,424] The Public Safety Communications   program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the  

[10:1:66,434] state's   public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The   program is dedicated to the  

[10:2:66,444] preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that  

[10:3:66,454] keep the public connected during times of crisis.  

[10:4:66,471] 9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE  

[11:0:66,490] The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of   Cal OES and support services such as

[7:0:66,347] The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five areas: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3)  

[7:1:66,357] Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief.  

[8:0:66,377] The Bureau of Firearms (BOF) provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms and  

[8:1:66,386] ammunition   laws by administering a multitude of different state-mandated firearms and ammunition-related programs. It is  

[8:2:66,396] accomplished by conducting firearm and ammunition eligibility checks, conducting compliance inspections at firearm dealers,  

[8:3:66,406] ammunition vendors, and manufacturers, and by providing valuable training to stakeholders statewide. BOF Special Agents  

[8:4:66,416] conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of firearms,  

[8:5:66,426] magazines, and ammunition. Finally, BOF Special Agents conduct investigations to monitor and   prevent illegal   firearm  

[8:6:66,435] trafficking at permitted gun shows in accordance with state and federal laws.  

[9:0:66,455] The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and scientific analysis of physical evidence, crime scene  

[9:1:66,465] investigation, and scientific investigative support for officer-involved shooting investigations. Additionally BFS provides expert  

[9:2:66,474] court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts. The BFS operates 10  

[9:3:66,484] regional crime laboratories and two specialized laboratories, the Jan Bashinski DNA Laboratory and Statewide Toxicology  

[9:4:66,494] Laboratory, which   serve 46 of California’s 58 counties. The BFS also operates the California Criminalistics Institute forensic  

[9:5:66,504] training facility that provides training for forensic scientists worldwide. Finally, BFS maintains the state DNA database, which  

[9:6:66,514] stores and regularly searches the DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees against the DNA profiles of  

[9:7:66,523] evidence from unsolved crimes.  

[10:0:66,543] The Bureau of Gambling Control (BGC) regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted  

[10:1:66,553] honestly and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of  

[10:2:66,562] individuals and business entities who apply for licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance  

[10:3:66,572] with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. BGC conducts criminal investigations in and around tribal casinos  

[10:4:66,582] and California cardrooms. In addition, BGC conducts audits and reviews for tribal gaming to ensure that each tribe is in  

[10:5:66,592] compliance with all aspects of the state gaming compact.  

[11:0:66,611] The Bureau of Investigation (BI) is the premiere investigative bureau that is responsible for investigating and dismantling  

[11:1:66,621] criminal organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses that present a significant and multi-

[11:2:66,631] jurisdictional threat to California. The BI prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal enterprises involved in gangs,  

[11:3:66,641] as well as cases involving major white-collar fraud, underground economy, recycle fraud, officer-involved shootings, homicides,  

[11:4:66,650] foreign prosecution, human trafficking and sexual predator apprehension crimes. In addition, BI serves a principal role in  

[11:5:66,660] providing leadership, coordination, and support to law enforcement through intelligence support centers and multi-agency task  

[11:6:66,670] forces focusing on violent offenders, gangs, and major crimes statewide.  

[12:0:66,689] The Office of the Chief (Office) provides administrative support to the investigative, regulatory, and forensic components of the  

[12:1:66,699] Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office serves as the policy-making and oversight body for  

[12:2:66,709] its four operational bureaus.

[2:0:207,32] 0840   State Controller - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The Personnel and Payroll Services Division (PPSD) processes payroll and leave accounting for all state civil service and  

[3:1:66,78] exempt employees, state court, and California State University employees. PPSD provides information required to manage the  

[3:2:66,88] personnel resources of the state and to properly account for salary and wage expenditures, provides data to the retirement  

[3:3:66,98] systems necessary for calculation of employee retirement benefits, and manages the state’s automated travel expense  

[3:4:66,108] reimbursement system.  

[4:0:66,127] Cal Employee Connect (CEC) and ConnectHR are SCO’s secure web-based customer service portals for state employees and  

[4:1:66,137] human resources staff, respectively. They were developed as interim solutions to provide some of the enhancements the  

[4:2:66,147] California State Payroll System Project (CSPS) will deliver when completed, to support a hybrid remote workforce and make  

[4:3:66,156] personnel and payroll transactions more efficient and paperless.  

[5:0:66,174] The CSPS Project was initiated to modernize the statewide human resource management, travel and business expense, and  

[5:1:66,183] payroll   systems as part of a fully integrated solution. The system should enable the state to improve management processes  

[5:2:66,193] and fulfill its payroll, reporting, and deduction processing obligations accurately and on time.

[17:0:66,575] The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to make sure they can provide  

[17:1:66,584] the benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and  

[17:2:66,594] underlying assumptions to ensure transparency and consistency in models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by  

[17:3:66,604] insurance companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty  

[17:4:66,614] insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the California Insurance Code  

[17:5:66,623] and the California Code of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance  

[17:6:66,633] sector; (6) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance  

[17:7:66,643] companies to get unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases  

[17:8:66,653] are actuarially justified and not excessive; and (8) perform market conduct reviews to ensure compliance; and (9) ensure that  

[17:9:66,662] applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure.

[2:0:181,32] 0845   Department of Insurance - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders  

[3:1:66,78] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or  

[3:2:66,88] underwriting by insurers and producers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent  

[3:3:66,98] practices and from incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved  

[3:4:66,108] and historically disadvantaged communities; and (4) assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community  

[3:5:66,117] service organizations, and neighborhood associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed  

[3:6:66,127] informational guides, workshops, seminars, roundtables, and town halls.  

[3:7:66,144] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL  

[4:0:66,162] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for  

[4:1:66,171] prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace  

[4:2:66,181] officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the  

[4:3:66,191] Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition,  

[4:4:66,201] the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against  

[4:5:66,211] perpetrators of insurance fraud.  

[4:6:66,228] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE

[5:1:66,255] contained in the Insurance Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and  

[5:2:66,265] Fee Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the  

[5:3:66,274] premium tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

[6:0:183,218] 0850   California State Lottery Commission  

[6:1:66,239] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an  

[6:2:66,249] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it  

[6:3:66,259] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to  

[6:4:66,268] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by  

[6:5:66,278] the State Senate.  

[7:0:66,296] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34  

[7:1:66,305] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be  

[7:2:66,315] used for administrative costs.  

[8:0:66,332] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost  

[8:1:66,342] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of  

[8:2:66,352] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery  

[8:3:66,362] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily  

[8:4:66,371] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the  

[8:5:66,381] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.  

[8:6:66,398] In the 38 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2023, the California State Lottery has raised $43.7 billion  

[8:7:66,408] for public education, including approximately $2.0 billion in 2022-23.  

[9:0:66,426] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2022-23 and 2023-24 cannot be made  

[9:1:66,435] with certainty.

[3:1:66,152] authority extends to the operation, concentration, and supervision of the cardrooms and all persons and things related to each  

[3:2:66,162] licensed establishment.  

[4:0:66,179] The Commission has fiduciary, regulatory, and administrative responsibilities related to Tribal gaming that include: (1)  

[4:1:66,189] distributing specified Tribal gaming revenues to Non-Compact, Non-Gaming and Limited-Gaming Tribes; (2) making suitability

[10:1:66,501] 0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES  

[11:0:66,521] The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption.  

[11:1:66,531] During the 2021-22 fiscal year, this Division handled 12,002 security investment transactions totaling $589.2 billion. The Pooled  

[11:2:66,540] Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 11,072 of these transactions totaling $552.9 billion; time deposits  

[11:3:66,550] accounted for 759 transactions totaling $23.3 billion. The remaining $13.0 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special  

[11:4:66,560] funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's  

[11:5:66,570] retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment  

[11:6:66,580] program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the  

[11:7:66,589] 2021-22 fiscal year, 2,387 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $36.0 billion for the fiscal year.  

[11:8:66,607] 0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT  

[12:0:66,626] In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System  

[12:1:66,636] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires  

[12:2:66,646] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,  

[12:3:66,655] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,  

[12:4:66,665] and loans to the General Fund.  

[13:0:66,685] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of  

[13:1:66,695] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that  

[13:2:66,704] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer  

[13:3:66,714] maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for  

[14:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[5:1:66,193] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The  

[5:2:66,203] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to  

[5:3:66,213] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.  

[6:0:66,232] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse  

[6:1:66,242] consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance   includes monitoring  

[6:2:66,252] the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and  

[6:3:66,262] ensuring proper record keeping.  

[7:0:66,279] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES

[11:0:66,629] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State  

[11:1:66,639] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,  

[11:2:66,649] such as the creation of affordable housing.  

[12:0:66,666] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual  

[12:1:66,676] basis. The bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by multiplying the state population by $110 in 2022; a factor determined  

[12:2:66,686] by the IRS each year. California's limit totaled over $4.3 billion in 2022.

[12:1:66,579] 0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[13:0:66,606] The Committee administers various programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity  

[13:1:66,616] bonds. Below is a summary of each program:  

[14:0:66,633] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost to develop multifamily rental  

[14:1:66,643] housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers produce  

[14:2:66,653] affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and families. To  

[14:3:66,662] qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or reserve at  

[14:4:66,672] least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for  

[14:5:66,682] four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint  

[14:6:66,692] Application.

[3:1:66,78] as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities,  

[3:2:66,88] high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the  

[3:3:66,98] project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to  

[3:4:66,108] protect and enhance the environment.  

[3:5:66,125] Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to assist first-time  

[3:6:66,135] homebuyers with purchasing homes. Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached,  

[3:7:66,144] condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the  

[3:8:66,154] program's purchase price limitations.

[12:0:66,567] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[13:0:66,586] The Federal Program  

[14:0:66,603] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax  

[14:1:66,613] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise  

[14:2:66,623] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and  

[14:3:66,633] indexed for inflation.  

[15:0:66,650] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the  

[15:1:66,660] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability  

[15:2:66,670] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of  

[15:3:66,679] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project  

[15:4:66,689] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each  

[15:5:66,699] year for a ten-year period.  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:410,13] 2023-24 STATE BUDGET — LJE   227 

[2:0:131,32] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation. For 2022, each  

[3:1:66,78] state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.60 per state resident. Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share  

[3:2:66,88] of unused credits in a national pool.  

[4:0:66,105] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects  

[4:1:66,115] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there  

[4:2:66,125] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments.  

[4:3:66,142] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires  

[4:4:66,152] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.  

[4:5:66,169] The State LIHTC Program  

[5:0:66,186] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the  

[5:1:66,196] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for  

[5:2:66,206] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax  

[5:3:66,216] credit status.  

[6:0:66,233] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2022, was $102 million. Investors take the state tax credit  

[6:1:66,243] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.  

[6:2:66,260] Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit  

[6:3:66,270] Allocation Committee to issue an additional $500 million in state low-income housing tax credits in 2020 to be paired with 4%  

[6:4:66,280] federal low-income housing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds to bolster new construction of low-income housing. Per AB 101,  

[6:5:66,289] this $500 million tax credit was issued for calendar years beginning in 2020, and for calendar years beginning in 2021 pursuant  

[6:6:66,299] to an authorization in the annual Budget Act or related legislation.  

[6:7:66,316] Farmworker Housing Program  

[7:0:66,334] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state  

[7:1:66,344] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,  

[7:2:66,353] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and  

[7:3:66,363] projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.  

[7:4:66,380] Beginning in 2024 through 2034 calendar year, AB 1654 allocates $25,000,000 of the $500,000,000 state low-income housing  

[7:5:66,390] tax credits to be set aside for farmworker housing.  

[7:6:66,407] State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits  

[8:0:66,425] SB 451 authorized $50,000,000 in historic tax credits per calendar year, for a five-year period, beginning in 2021. These tax  

[8:1:66,434] credits are allocated by California Tax Credit Allocation Committee in conjunction with and upon approval from the Office of  

[8:2:66,444] Historic Preservation.

[6:1:279,213] Authority  

[7:0:66,234] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes  

[7:1:66,244] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently  

[7:2:66,254] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the  

[7:3:66,264] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  

[7:4:66,273] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,  

[7:5:66,283] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and  

[7:6:66,293] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit  

[7:7:66,303] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities  

[7:8:66,312] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.  

[8:0:66,332] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director  

[8:1:66,342] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,  

[8:2:66,351] and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[5:0:66,189] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[6:0:66,208] 0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY  

[7:0:66,227] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the  

[7:1:66,237] Authority,   loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and  

[7:2:66,247] approved by resolution of the Authority.  

[8:0:66,264] The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and  

[8:1:66,274] private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects  

[8:2:66,284] in California.  

[9:0:66,303] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative  

[9:1:66,313] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program   expanded   (Chapter 677, Statutes of  

[9:2:66,323] 2012)   to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes  

[9:3:66,333] of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment  

[9:4:66,342] that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product.   In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended  

[9:5:66,352] the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria  

[9:6:66,362] by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. In 2022, Chapter 251, Statutes of 2022, authorized CAEATFA an additional  

[9:7:66,372] $15 million per calendar year in STE for specific lithium projects for years 2022 to 2024. The objective of this program is to  

[9:8:66,381] promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases,  

[9:9:66,391] air and water pollution, and energy consumption.  

[10:0:66,411] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013  

[10:1:66,420] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority  

[10:2:66,430] developed a loan loss reserve program   for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and   a risk  

[10:3:66,440] mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. Programs to support low-interest  

[10:4:66,450] financing of Property Assessed Clean Energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings are in discussion.  

[11:0:66,469] The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in  

[11:1:66,479] collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission   to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot programs   to  

[11:2:66,489] encourage and leverage private capital lending   (in both the residential and commercial sectors). These programs   employ  

[11:3:66,499] various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making   energy efficiency  

[11:4:66,508] improvements   to help achieve the state's   energy efficiency and decarbonization   goals.

[4:0:66,120] California Pollution Control Financing Authority (CPCFA) is committed to stimulating local economies in California by making  

[4:1:66,130] capital more accessible to small businesses and delivering innovative financing for projects that protect and restore the  

[4:2:66,139] environment.  

[5:0:66,157] Created in 1972, CPCFA originated as a conduit issuer of tax-exempt, pollution-control bonds and now assists the solid-waste,  

[5:1:66,166] recycling, water, and wastewater industries through its Private Activity Tax-Exempt Bond Program. Over the last 50 years,  

[5:2:66,176] CPCFA evolved to include financing programs assisting California's small business sector through its California Capital Access  

[5:3:66,186] Program (CalCAP) and to promote the reuse and redevelopment of brownfields through the California Recycle Underutilized  

[5:4:66,196] Sites Program (CALReUSE).

[1:0:382,13] LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[2:0:116,32] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] 0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,86] CPCFA’s Tax-Exempt Bond Program provides access to the tax-exempt bond market for private companies serving a public  

[4:1:66,96] purpose, through the use of private activity bonds. California businesses may use private activity bonds for the acquisition,  

[4:2:66,105] construction, or installation of qualified waste disposal, waste recovery, water furnishing, and wastewater treatment, or the  

[4:3:66,115] acquisition and installation of new equipment. In addition, CPCFA maintains a Small Business Assistance Fund (SBAF) that  

[4:4:66,125] provides cost of issuance financial assistance to qualified small business borrowers.  

[5:0:66,142] Tax-exempt financing issued by CPCFA assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California  

[5:1:66,152] Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly  

[5:2:66,162] Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). As of June 30,  

[5:3:66,171] 2022, bonds totaling approximately $16.9 billion have been issued by CPCFA.  

[6:0:66,189] 0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  

[7:0:66,206] CalCAP for Small Business incentivizes banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses through the  

[7:1:66,216] use of a loan loss reserve account. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund specific to each  

[7:2:66,226] participating financial institution. CPCFA, the financial institution, and the borrower all contribute to fund the reserve. CPCFA  

[7:3:66,235] provides additional incentives for lending to businesses located in underserved communities and disaster areas. The reserve  

[7:4:66,245] serves to reduce loan-loss risk, supporting financial institutions when they lend to California small businesses.  

[8:0:66,262] Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA’s Small Business Assistance Fund  

[8:1:66,272] (SBAF), established with fees collected from large companies utilizing CPCFA's tax-exempt bond program. In October 2010  

[8:2:66,282] CalCAP received $6 million from the General Fund (Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010) to increase lending efforts. The $6 million  

[8:3:66,292] appropriation was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to become the primary  

[8:4:66,301] source for the State's contributions.  

[9:0:66,319] In 2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from U.S. Treasury's State Small  

[9:1:66,329] Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). CPCFA shared the allocation with the Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank  

[9:2:66,338] (IBank), now housed within the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz).  

[10:0:66,356] These funds enabled CPCFA to expand the availability of its CalCAP for Small Business (CalCAP SB). In addition, CPCFA  

[10:1:66,365] launched the Collateral Support Program (CSP) to further offset financial institution’s resistance to lend after the 2008  

[10:2:66,375] recession. CPCFA created the CSP with a recapture provision allowing for the sustainability of the program.  

[11:0:66,392] The SSBCI program ended in 2017. In an effort to sustain the program past the sunset date, CalCAP SB instituted a recapture  

[11:1:66,402] provision. Funds are being recaptured annually to sustain the CalCAP SB and the CSP.   In 2021, the federal government  

[11:2:66,412] reauthorized the funding of SSBCI (SSBCI 2.0). CPCFA and IBank partnered again to apply for SSBCI 2.0 allocation and will  

[11:3:66,422] share the $1.181 billion allocated to California. Recapture has been suspended for the SSBCI 2.0 program.  

[12:0:66,439] Utilizing the CalCAP model, CPCFA partnered with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to assist truck and bus owners  

[12:1:66,449] in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds to  

[12:2:66,459] incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that comply with CARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. CPCFA also partnered with the  

[12:3:66,468] California Energy Commission (CEC) to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit enhancements and rebates to  

[12:4:66,478] small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to install electric vehicle charging stations. The CalCAP Electric Vehicle  

[12:5:66,488] Charging Station (EVCS) Financing Program ended March 31, 2022.  

[13:0:66,505] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM  

[14:0:66,522] The California Recycle Underutilized Sites (CALReUSE) program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized  

[14:1:66,532] properties with real or perceived contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the  

[14:2:66,542] development of contaminated properties (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000,  

[14:3:66,552] the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per  

[14:4:66,561] brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the  

[14:5:66,571] development of remedial action plans. Eligible projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped  

[14:6:66,581] due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time  

[14:7:66,591] frames and the regulatory process.  

[15:0:66,608] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund  

[15:1:66,618] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received  

[15:2:66,628] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds  

[16:0:66,645] and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project for brownfield remediation that promoted affordable infill residential  

[16:1:66,655] and mixed-used developments. Three projects were pre-approved to receive awards of more than $5 million; one grant was  

[16:2:66,664] increased above $5 million when returned funds became available. All CALReUSE Program funds have been awarded. The  

[16:3:66,674] CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites in 30 California communities has leveraged the  

[16:4:66,684] completion of2,310 housing units to date, of which 80% are affordable.

[2:0:116,32] 0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative  

[3:1:66,78] energy production, CPCFA is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's  

[3:2:66,88] environmental goals. CPCFA is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and state  

[3:3:66,98] agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.  

[3:4:66,115] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES  

[3:5:66,132] The objective of the California Capital Access program for Americans with Disabilities (CalCAP/ADA) created by Chapter 787,  

[3:6:66,142] Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and increase  

[3:7:66,152] access for   employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other financial institutions to make loans to very small  

[3:8:66,162] businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided CPCFA an appropriation of $10 million effective January  

[3:9:66,171] 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the CalCAP model   incentivizing lenders to enroll qualifying  

[3:10:66,181] loans.   The program also offers borrowers a rebate toward the cost of the Certified Access Specialist (CAS) Report.  

[3:11:66,198] 0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,218] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time  

[4:1:66,228] allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement   program for   qualified small businesses  

[4:2:66,238] and residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of  

[4:3:66,247] Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other  

[4:4:66,257] financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the  

[4:5:66,267] program.  

[5:0:66,284] 0878 - CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,301] The California Investment and Innovation Program is authorized by Chapter 68, Statutes of 2022, (SB 193) and was provided a  

[6:1:66,311] one-time allocation of $50 million from the General Fund into a new special fund, the California Investment and Innovation  

[6:2:66,321] Fund, to support a new grant program to provide local assistance to the state’s Community Development Financial Institutions

[12:4:66,620] provide pediatric services for children eligible for California Children’s Services. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is  

[12:5:66,630] derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition  

[12:6:66,640] 3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4.

[18:3:66,589] counties, the program funds facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs for  

[18:4:66,598] facilities that provide services to this population.  

[19:0:66,616] • No Place Like Home Program  

[20:0:66,633] Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program, which requires the Department  

[20:1:66,643] of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to award up to $2 billion to counties for the acquisition, design, construction,

[11:0:66,494] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[11:1:66,513] 0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD  

[12:0:66,532] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which  

[12:1:66,542] allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can  

[12:2:66,552] make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings.  

[12:3:66,562] ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability  

[12:4:66,572] expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the  

[12:5:66,581] State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.  

[13:0:66,601] The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the  

[13:1:66,611] purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse  

[13:2:66,620] needs of our customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in  

[13:3:66,630] providing financial services.  

[14:0:66,647] Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $17,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's  

[14:1:66,657] ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary. Funds may accumulate and grow  

[14:2:66,667] in CalABLE investments with no federal or state income taxes or penalties as long as the money is used to pay for qualified  

[14:3:66,677] expenses when withdrawn. 

[15:0:66,694] In 2022, Governor Newsom signed AB 2216 into law, limiting state protections from Medi-Cal recovery upon the death of an  

[15:1:66,704] ABLE beneficiary, only to CalABLE account holders, and permitting CalABLE account holders who are working to contribute up  

[15:2:66,714] to the full amount allowable under the federal ABLE to Work provision.

[5:4:66,190] workplace retirement savings plans. The Board’s mission is to ensure all Californians have a path to financial security in  

[5:5:66,200] retirement by providing a simple, portable, low-cost way for workers to invest in their futures.  

[6:0:66,217] The Board consists of nine members: the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the Director of the Department of Finance, the State  

[6:1:66,227] Controller, a retirement savings and investment expert appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, an employee  

[6:2:66,237] representative appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly, a small business representative appointed by the Governor, a public

[8:0:66,392] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance  

[8:1:66,402] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are available for loans to schools and  

[8:2:66,412] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,  

[8:3:66,422] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB  

[8:4:66,431] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.  

[8:5:66,449] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,468] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program  

[9:1:66,478] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the  

[9:2:66,488] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University  

[9:3:66,497] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50  

[9:4:66,507] percent state subsidy for charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the state)  

[9:5:66,517] by the charter school via a 30-year loan. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be financially sound,  

[9:6:66,527] and meet other program eligibility requirements. 

[10:0:66,544] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,561] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA received grants under the United States Department of Education’s State Charter School  

[11:1:66,571] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.  

[11:2:66,581] Grant funds reimburse a charter school’s costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities  

[11:3:66,591] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on  

[11:4:66,600] preference points assigned based on: the percentage of low-income students; percentage of overcrowding; not-for-profit status;  

[11:5:66,610] and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. This program sunset in  

[11:6:66,620] December 2022.  

[12:0:66,637] 0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM  

[13:0:66,655] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and  

[13:1:66,664] lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged  

[13:2:66,674] students. Eligible charter schools are provided the lesser of $1,421 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, or 75 percent  

[13:3:66,684] of annual facilities rent and lease costs.

[16:1:66,700] facilities. Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms

[3:0:66,68] construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or  

[3:1:66,78] the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating  

[3:2:66,88] institution is pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private activity"  

[3:3:66,98] bond ceiling as specified in federal law.  

[4:0:66,127] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "participating private college" means a nonprofit,  

[4:1:66,137] private, regionally accredited, degree-granting college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's  

[4:2:66,146] race or ethnicity and provided that the financing does not violate constitutional provisions.  

[5:0:66,176] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to  

[5:1:66,185] issue tax-exempt public offering or private placement loans for participating institutions, which may provide greater cost savings  

[5:2:66,195] than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.  

[6:0:66,215] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND  

[7:0:66,232] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the  

[7:1:66,242] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,  

[7:2:66,251] added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January  

[7:3:66,261] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax  

[7:4:66,271] credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.   Chapter 976, Statues of 2022,
