[3:0:66,68] 5900 - EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RELATED SERVICES  

[4:0:66,88] The objective of the Employment and Employment Related Services Program is to provide a variety of services to facilitate a  

[4:1:66,98] match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an internet labor exchange system to facilitate  

[4:2:66,108] this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to  

[4:3:66,117] provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans,  

[4:4:66,127] youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited  

[4:5:66,137] locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable employment.  

[5:0:66,154] 5915 - CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD  

[6:0:66,174] The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct  

[6:1:66,183] impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax  

[6:2:66,193] liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one  

[6:3:66,203] each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly.  

[7:0:66,223] The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the  

[7:1:66,232] Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit  

[7:2:66,242] programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction.  

[8:0:66,259] 5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[9:0:66,279] The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California  

[9:1:66,289] workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income  

[9:2:66,299] replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  

[10:0:66,316] 5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM  

[11:0:66,335] The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing  

[11:1:66,345] monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take  

[11:2:66,355] time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-

[11:3:66,365] law or to bond with a new minor child, or to participate in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to  

[11:4:66,374] covered active duty of the individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States.  

[12:0:66,392] 5930 - TAX PROGRAM  

[13:0:66,409] The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax  

[13:1:66,419] collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support  

[13:2:66,429] the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs.  

[14:0:66,446] 5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL  

[15:0:66,463] The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including  

[15:1:66,473] small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages  

[15:2:66,483] and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention  

[15:3:66,492] and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes  

[15:4:66,502] special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout  

[15:5:66,512] the state.  

[16:0:66,529] 5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  

[17:0:66,549] The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment  

[17:1:66,559] Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide  

[17:2:66,568] and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California SM   in local  

[17:3:66,582] communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce,  

[17:4:66,592] veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to  

[17:5:66,601] job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention,  

[17:6:66,611] earnings, and occupational skills of participants.  

[18:0:66,629] 5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS  

[19:0:66,648] The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as the National Emergency Grant Program,  

[19:1:66,658] consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due  

[19:2:66,668] to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to  

[19:3:66,677] react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

[10:1:66,453] 6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD  

[11:0:66,473] The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the  

[11:1:66,482] Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public  

[11:2:66,492] sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and  

[11:3:66,502] dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by  

[11:4:66,512] the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial   courts.  

[12:0:66,531] The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to:  

[12:1:65,549] • Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively  

[12:2:76,558] represent them in their labor relations with their employer.  

[13:0:65,574] • Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees,  

[13:1:76,584] and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws.  

[13:2:65,600] • Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings.  

[13:3:65,615] • Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it  

[13:4:76,625] administers.  

[14:0:66,652] OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL  

[15:0:66,672] The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and  

[15:1:66,682] presiding over informal settlement conferences. The Office of the General Counsel also oversees the statutory process through  

[15:2:66,691] which employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their  

[15:3:66,701] employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains  

[15:4:66,711] enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions.

[8:0:66,459] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[9:0:66,478] 6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS  

[10:0:66,495] This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group of  

[10:1:66,505] employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is  

[10:2:66,515] actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-

[10:3:66,524] sector employer post a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer  

[10:4:66,534] defaults on its obligations.  

[11:0:66,551] 6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[12:0:66,569] The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize  

[12:1:66,578] disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides  

[12:2:66,588] administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits.  

[12:3:66,598] The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system  

[12:4:66,608] required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured  

[12:5:66,618] Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and  

[12:6:66,627] sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system  

[12:7:66,637] designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system.  

[12:8:66,647] Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical  

[12:9:66,657] Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-

[12:10:66,666] based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by  

[12:11:66,676] identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system.  

[13:0:66,693] The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'  

[13:1:66,703] compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court,  

[13:2:66,713] and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.

[3:0:66,68] 6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION  

[4:0:66,86] The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for monitoring the workers’ compensation  

[4:1:66,96] and health and safety program. This involves conducting continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the  

[4:2:66,105] state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and occupational diseases, which includes making recommendations on how to  

[4:3:66,115] improve the workers' compensation and health and safety program, as well as maintaining the occupational safety and health  

[4:4:66,125] training and education program. The Commission conducts specified surveys and evaluations required by law and issues an  

[4:5:66,135] annual report on the state of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative  

[4:6:66,144] modifications. The Commission also issues, if necessary, a report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification  

[4:7:66,154] of the notices required to be provided by insurers and self-insured employers.  

[5:0:66,171] 6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  

[6:0:66,189] The Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) promotes and enforces the sections of the Labor Code that protect  

[6:1:66,198] the health and safety of workers on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways,  

[6:2:66,208] and pressure vessels for the benefit of the general public. The coordinated efforts of Cal/OSHA, the Occupational Safety and  

[6:3:66,218] Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (Appeals Board)  

[6:4:66,228] accomplish these objectives.  

[7:0:66,245] Cal/OSHA enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries and  

[7:1:66,255] helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. Cal/OSHA conducts inspections and issues permits for the  

[7:2:66,265] operation of elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways and pressure vessels. The  

[7:3:66,274] inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these  

[7:4:66,284] devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, Cal/OSHA also obtains and maintains job safety  

[7:5:66,294] records, reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and  

[7:6:66,304] provides accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by  

[7:7:66,314] state and local government.  

[8:0:66,331] The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as  

[8:1:66,341] follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor,  

[8:2:66,350] one member from the field of occupational health and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in  

[8:3:66,360] the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards  

[8:4:66,370] enforced by Cal/OSHA.  

[9:0:66,387] The Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations and  

[9:1:66,397] accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by Cal/OSHA for occupational safety and health standards violations. It is  

[10:0:66,407] comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from  

[10:1:66,416] the field of management and one member from the field of labor.  

[11:0:66,434] 6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT  

[12:0:66,451] The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (Labor Commissioner’s Office) interprets and enforces the sections of the Labor  

[12:1:66,461] Code which relate to wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees  

[12:2:66,471] engaged in protected activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders. This work is conducted  

[12:3:66,480] by providing field enforcement of laws governing public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed  

[13:0:66,490] contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the payment of overtime and minimum wage; making wage determinations  

[13:1:66,500] and collecting unpaid wages; the licensing of specific industries; the payment of wages without required deductions;  

[14:0:66,510] administration of the prevailing wage program and enforcement of apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works  

[14:1:66,519] projects. Under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, the Labor Commissioner’s Office conducts vigorous and  

[14:2:66,529] targeted enforcement in partnership with state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the  

[14:3:66,539] "underground economy".  

[15:0:66,556] 6106 - INDUSTRIAL WELFARE COMMISSION  

[16:0:66,574] The   Industrial Welfare Commission regulates wages, hours and working conditions in California. 

[17:0:66,591] 6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS  

[18:0:66,608] The Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS) matches the needs of workers with those of employers, and strengthens the  

[18:1:66,618] apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting workers and teaching the skills they and  

[18:2:66,628] their employers need. The goals of DAS are to promote, develop and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs,  

[18:3:66,637] as well as provide consultation services to program sponsors. DAS administers the apprenticeship system in California under  

[18:4:66,647] the administrative direction of the Office of the Director. This includes initial program approval and subsequent oversight activity  

[18:5:66,657] such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs and employers are  

[18:6:66,667] in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. The Chief also serves as the Secretary of two apprenticeship bodies:  

[18:7:66,677] The California Apprenticeship Council (CAC) and the Interagency Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship (IACA).   The CAC  

[18:8:66,686] issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the general policy under which this program  

[18:9:66,696] operates. The IACA advises DAS on apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship opportunities in developing new apprenticeship  

[18:10:66,706] programs in industries like healthcare, information technology, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and accounting for public and  

[18:11:66,716] private employers.

[4:0:66,86] The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers'  

[4:1:66,96] compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required  

[4:2:66,105] under the Labor Code.  

[5:0:66,123] The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor  

[5:1:66,132] Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be  

[5:2:66,142] disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
