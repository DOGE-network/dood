[1:0:68,43] 2670   Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and 

[1:1:285,57] Suisun 

[2:0:66,78] The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses 

[2:1:66,89] and regulates maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on 

[2:2:66,99] tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton. 

[3:0:66,119] The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident 

[3:1:66,129] investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and 

[3:2:66,140] providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the 

[3:3:66,150] Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board 

[3:4:66,160] was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850. 

[4:0:66,180] All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by 

[4:1:66,191] the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost 

[4:2:66,201] of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Three separate surcharges are based upon ship movements 

[4:3:66,211] and fund a pilot continuing education program, a pilot trainee training program, and the acquisition of navigation technology for 

[4:4:66,221] use by pilots. Two separate surcharges are based upon the tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay 

[4:5:66,231] and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.
