[1:0:157,43] 5225   Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation  

[1:1:66,64] The mission of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is to enhance public safety through safe  

[1:2:66,74] and secure incarceration of inmates, effective parole supervision, and rehabilitative strategies to successfully reintegrate  

[1:3:66,84] inmates into our communities.  

[1:4:66,102] CDCR is organized into the following programs:  

[1:5:65,120] • Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration  

[1:6:65,136] • Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development  

[1:7:65,152] • Juvenile: Operations and Offender Programs; Academic and Vocational Education; Health Care Services  

[1:8:65,168] • Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations: Security; Inmate Support; Contracted Facilities; Institution Administration  

[1:9:65,185] • Parole Operations: Adult Supervision; Adult Community Based Programs; Administration; Sex Offender Management Board

[17:1:66,356] 6100-6106.  

[18:0:66,393] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[19:0:65,411] •  Adult Inmate and Parolee Population– Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the adult inmate average daily population is  

[19:1:76,421] projected to   decrease by   1,019 in 2019-20, to a total of 125,871. Compared to 2018-19 at the 2018 Budget Act, the 2019  

[19:2:76,431] Budget Act projects an increase in the average daily parolee population of 1,907 in 2019-20, to a total of 50,442.  

[20:0:65,448] •  Adult Medical and Pharmaceutical Program– Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the population of adult inmates in CDCR-

[20:1:76,458] operated prisons receiving in-prison medical services is projected to increase by 443 in 2019-20, to a total of 117,896. Based  

[20:2:76,468] on the current Medical Classification Model staffing ratios and pharmaceutical cost projection, these changes will result in  

[20:3:76,478] General Fund expenditure increases of $23.3 million in 2018-19 and $26.3 million in 2019-20.  

[21:0:65,494] •  Juvenile Ward Population– Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the ward population is projected to increase by 136 in  

[21:1:76,505] 2019-20 to a total of 782. The increase is driven by continued implementation of the Young Adult Program, which redirects  

[21:2:76,515] certain young adult male offenders from adult prison into a juvenile facility. These changes result in General Fund  

[21:3:76,525] expenditure increases of $3.6 million in 2018-19 and $15 million in 2019-20, exclusive of revenues and adjustments to  

[21:4:76,535] reimbursement authority. These amounts also include corrections for certain living units originally budgeted in prior years.  

[22:0:65,551] •  Mental Health Program– Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the population of inmates requiring outpatient mental health  

[22:1:76,562] treatment is projected to decrease by 306 in 2019-20, to a total of 35,360. Based on the current Mental Health Staffing  

[22:2:76,572] Ratios the Mental Health Program will note General Fund expenditure decreases of $1.1 million in 2018-19 and $8.7 million  

[22:3:76,582] in 2019-20.  

[23:0:65,598] •  Prison Roof Replacements– The Budget includes a total of $71.7 million General Fund over two years for roof replacement  

[23:1:76,608] projects at High Desert State Prison and California State Prison, Solano, as part of a broad, multiyear plan to replace aging  

[23:2:76,619] and deteriorating roofs across the state prison system.  

[24:0:65,635] •  Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program– The Budget includes $71.3 million General Fund in 2019-20,  

[24:1:76,645] increasing to $164.8 million ongoing General Fund in 2021-22, to implement a statewide integrated substance use disorder  

[24:2:76,655] treatment program. The program includes use of medication-assisted treatment to treat inmates with opioid and alcohol use  

[24:3:76,665] disorders, redesign of the current cognitive behavioral treatment curriculum, development and management of inmate  

[24:4:76,676] treatment plans, as well as substance use disorder-specific pre-release transition planning.  

[25:0:65,692] •  Contract Medical Augmentation– The Budget includes $61.9 million one-time General Fund to support the expanded  

[25:1:76,702] usage of contract medical services for inmates who require treatment that cannot be provided in prison clinical environments.  

[26:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:398,13] CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION 

[2:0:122,32] 5225   Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation - Continued 

[3:0:76,69] The Receiver’s office will update contract medical funding as part of the population adjustment processes.  

[4:0:65,85] •  Fire Alarm Replacement and Fire System Repair– The Budget includes a total of $59 million General Fund over two years  

[4:1:76,95] to replace fire alarm systems and repair fire suppression systems at Mule Creek State Prison, R.J. Donovan Correctional  

[4:2:76,105] Facility, and California State Prison, Sacramento. These funds will replace aging and outdated fire alarm systems and bring  

[4:3:76,115] the existing fire suppression systems into code compliance.  

[5:0:65,132] •  Medical Classification Model Updates– The Budget includes $27.9 million ongoing General Fund for the Receiver's  

[5:1:76,142] Medical Classification Model to provide increased staffing levels for health care operations throughout California’s prison  

[5:2:76,152] system. The Medical Classification Model uses a ratio-based methodology for adjusting medical staffing levels based on  

[5:3:76,162] inmate medical classification. The inmate population has grown older and sicker and is experiencing an increase in trauma-

[5:4:76,172] related incidents, which requires an update to specific model factors that determine resource needs.  

[6:0:65,189] •  Fleet– The Budget includes $23.7 million one-time General Fund to replace fleet assets that serve mission-critical functions.  

[7:0:65,205] •  Prison Maintenance– The Budget includes $18.5 million   General Fund to establish a new funding methodology and  

[7:1:76,215] increase the baseline budget for annual prison maintenance and repair costs based on a square footage rather than a per  

[7:2:76,225] inmate calculation.   The Budget also includes $25 million one-time General Fund to address the Department's highest  

[7:3:76,235] priority deferred maintenance projects.  

[8:0:65,252] •  Division of Juvenile Justice Reorganization– The Budget includes $1.2 million   ongoing General Fund to facilitate  

[8:1:76,262] transition of the Division of Juvenile Justice to the California Health and Human Services Agency, as well as to launch a new

[5:1:66,124] decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process.  

[6:0:66,142] For adult offenders, the Board of Parole Hearings is responsible for setting the terms and conditions of parole and conducting  

[6:1:66,152] parole consideration hearings for eligible inmates serving life sentences, including certain parole violators pursuant to Penal  

[6:2:66,163] Code Section 3000.1. In January 2014, the Board began conducting youth offender parole hearings for eligible offenders  

[6:3:66,173] sentenced under both the Indeterminate Sentence Law and Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to Chapter 312, Statutes of  

[6:4:66,183] 2013. In 2014, the Board also began conducting parole hearings for inmates eligible for elderly parole sentenced under both

[6:7:66,214] same federal court order. The Board also conducts medical parole hearings and determines whether parolees should be  

[6:8:66,224] discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for mentally disordered offenders and sexually violent predators, and  

[6:9:66,234] subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of Mental Health. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board  

[6:10:66,244] investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons and commutations of sentence, including those involving  

[6:11:66,254] the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the

[7:4:66,323] addresses the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to that of adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any  

[7:5:66,333] subsequent growth and increased maturity of the individual. Chapter 675, Statutes of 2017 (AB 1308) expands youth offender

[1:0:164,43] 5227   Board of State and Community Corrections  

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and  

[2:1:66,74] technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal  

[2:2:66,84] justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety  

[2:3:66,95] Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention,  

[2:4:66,105] intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is  

[2:5:66,115] consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based  

[2:6:66,125] strategies for managing criminal justice populations.  

[3:0:66,146] Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a  

[3:1:66,156] capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure  

[3:2:66,166] Overview."

[1:0:215,43] 5420   Prison Industry Authority  

[2:0:66,64] The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries  

[2:1:66,74] in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate  

[2:2:66,84] board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections  

[2:3:66,95] and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee,  

[2:4:66,105] the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker  

[2:5:66,115] of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the  

[2:6:66,125] Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the  

[2:7:66,135] Board.  

[3:0:66,156] The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good  

[3:1:66,166] work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA  

[3:2:66,176] work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming.  

[4:0:66,197] The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that  

[4:1:66,207] provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within  

[4:2:66,217] enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work  

[4:3:66,227] productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work  

[5:0:66,237] programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services  

[5:1:66,248] to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its  

[5:2:66,258] operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
