[1:0:68,69] 2670   Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and  

[1:1:285,83] Suisun  

[2:0:66,104] The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses  

[2:1:66,113] and regulates the maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on  

[2:2:66,123] tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton.  

[3:0:66,143] The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident  

[3:1:66,152] investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and  

[3:2:66,162] providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the  

[3:3:66,172] Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board  

[3:4:66,182] was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850.  

[4:0:66,201] All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by  

[4:1:66,211] the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost  

[4:2:66,221] of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Four separate surcharges are based upon ship movements  

[4:3:66,231] and fund a continuing education program for pilots, a pilot trainee training program, the acquisition of the Pilot Dispatch  

[4:4:66,240] Program for use by pilots, and one temporarily funds pilot boat maintenance. Two separate surcharges are based on the  

[4:5:66,250] tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the  

[4:6:66,260] San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.
