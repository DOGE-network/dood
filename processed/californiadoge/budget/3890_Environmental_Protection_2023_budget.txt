[1:0:211,39] 3900   State Air Resources Board  

[2:0:66,60] The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes  

[3:0:66,70] establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in  

[3:1:66,79] conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.  

[4:0:66,89] Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans  

[4:1:66,99] include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources, fuels, consumer products, and industrial sources  

[5:0:66,109] established by the Board and local air districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility to develop measures to  

[5:1:66,118] reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006  

[5:2:66,128] (AB 32), Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 32), and Chapter 337, Statutes of 2022 (AB 1279). The Air Resources Board  

[5:3:66,138] oversees an extensive portfolio of incentives intended to reduce air pollution (including greenhouse gases), support shifts  

[5:4:66,148] towards less-polluting transportation options, and advance zero emission technologies, among other purposes. The Air  

[5:5:66,158] Resources Board is also responsible for developing guidance for agencies administering California Climate Investments  

[6:0:66,167] programs to ensure statutory requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are met, including maximizing benefits for  

[6:1:66,177] disadvantaged communities, reporting, and quantification methods, pursuant to Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014 (SB 862), and  

[6:2:66,187] serves as the account administrator for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.   The Air Resources Board also implements the  

[6:3:66,197] Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136,  

[6:4:66,206] Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with local air districts, the business community, scientists,  

[6:5:66,216] community representatives, and other stakeholders to implement its programs.  

[7:0:66,236] Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay  

[7:1:66,245] program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[15:0:66,695] The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund  

[15:1:66,705] program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,290 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups,  

[15:2:66,715] and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 249 sites where the cleanup process is complete.

[2:0:136,32] 3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued 

[3:0:66,68] Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,061 land-use restrictions in  

[3:1:66,78] place on properties throughout the state.  

[4:0:66,96] New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other  

[4:1:66,105] previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to  

[4:2:66,115] return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties,  

[4:3:66,125] abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military  

[4:4:66,135] installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former  

[4:5:66,144] hazardous waste disposal site.  

[5:0:66,162] The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness  

[5:1:66,171] for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills  

[5:2:66,181] and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.  

[6:0:66,198] 3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT  

[7:0:66,216] The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of  

[7:1:66,226] hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at  

[7:2:66,235] 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 800 registered businesses that transport hazardous  

[7:3:66,245] waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300  

[7:4:66,255] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[7:5:66,265] assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of  

[7:6:66,274] the Unified Program.  

[8:0:66,292] The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[8:1:66,301] electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste  

[8:2:66,311] requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused  

[8:3:66,321] enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste  

[8:4:66,331] and used oil.  

[9:0:66,348] 3626 - HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES  

[10:0:66,365] The Hazardous Waste Facilities program oversees the hazardous waste permitted facilities that are permitting for storage,  

[10:1:66,375] treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees the  

[10:2:66,385] maintenance activities and compliance at 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste and approximately 300  

[10:3:66,395] facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial  

[10:4:66,404] assurance resources.  

[11:0:66,422] The program monitors permitted hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including  

[11:1:66,431] electronic manifest surveillance, enforcement of hazardous waste requirement violations found through routine inspections;  

[11:2:66,441] complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused enforcement initiatives.  

[12:0:66,459] 3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS  

[13:0:66,476] The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic  

[13:1:66,486] chemicals that are used in consumer products. The SCP program calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by  

[13:2:66,495] identifying safer alternatives that eliminate or reduce the use of hazardous chemicals which may harm people or the  

[13:3:66,505] environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order to identify Priority  

[13:4:66,515] Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the analysis of safer  

[13:5:66,525] alternatives, and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption of "green  

[13:6:66,534] chemistry" practices.  

[14:0:66,552] 3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY  

[15:0:66,569] The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)  

[15:1:66,579] in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified  

[15:2:66,589] Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for  

[15:3:66,598] owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response  

[15:4:66,608] plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements  

[15:5:66,618] pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.  

[16:0:66,635] 3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM  

[17:0:66,652] The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities  

[17:1:66,662] surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as closure and corrective action at the facility  

[17:2:66,672] itself. Under the program, the department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including  

[17:3:66,682] residences, schools, daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7-mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated  

[17:4:66,692] soil at those properties with the highest levels of lead in soil and greatest potential for exposure.

[4:1:66,279] 3700 - Waste Reduction and Management  

[5:0:66,298] The objectives of the Waste Reduction and Management Program include:  

[5:1:65,316] • Overseeing that all nonhazardous solid waste is stored, collected, processed, and disposed in a safe and environmentally  

[5:2:76,325] sound manner.  

[6:0:65,341] • Participating in the development and maintenance of local solid waste management plans that describe how each city and  

[6:1:76,351] county will reduce solid waste disposal to achieve at minimum a 50 percent diversion of waste from landfills.  

[6:2:65,367] • Developing programs and policies to support the state goal that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source  

[6:3:76,377] reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020 and after.  

[7:0:65,392] • Reducing organic waste disposal 75 percent   by 2025 to support the state’s climate goals and rescue at least 20 percent   of  

[7:1:76,402] currently disposed surplus food by 2025.  

[8:0:65,418] • Cleaning up solid waste disposal sites when the responsible party either cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to pay  

[8:1:76,428] for timely remediation, and where cleanup is needed to protect public health and safety, or the environment.  

[8:2:65,443] • Developing and promoting waste reduction strategies through reuse, upcycling, and source reduction.  

[8:3:65,459] • Promoting the use of recycled materials in California manufacturing.  

[9:0:65,475] • Reducing the number of tires placed in landfills, illegally dumped, or stockpiled while promoting technologies turning waste  

[9:1:76,485] tires into useful products.  

[10:0:65,500] • Reducing the amount of improperly disposed used oil and promoting used oil recycling.  

[10:1:65,516] • Reducing electronic waste by providing safe and convenient collection and recycling of specified electronic equipment.  

[10:2:65,532] • Responding to local recovery needs following natural disasters by coordinating debris removal operations in collaboration  

[10:3:76,542] with federal, state, and local agency partners.  

[10:4:66,559] 3710 - Education and the Environment Initiative  

[11:0:66,579] In cooperation with the State Department of Education and the State Board of Education, the Office of Education and the  

[11:1:66,588] Environment develops and implements a unified education strategy for educating pupils, faculty, and administrators on the  

[11:2:66,598] importance of integrating environmental concepts and principles for elementary and secondary schools.  

[11:3:66,615] 3715 - Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction  

[12:0:66,635] CalRecycle administers the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction program with a goal of achieving an 80-percent  

[12:1:66,645] recycling rate for glass, aluminum, and plastic beverage containers sold in California. To achieve this goal, the Division of  

[12:2:66,655] Recycling oversees the following: (1) that   the California Redemption Value (CRV) is paid by beverage distributors for each  

[12:3:66,664] beverage sold in California; (2) that consumers are refunded CRV for recycled beverage containers; (3) that recycling centers  

[12:4:66,674] are conveniently located; (4) that grants are made to encourage recycling and development of markets for recycled materials;  

[12:5:66,684] (5) that strong oversight and enforcement programs are in place to protect the integrity of the Beverage Container Recycling  

[12:6:66,694] Fund; and (6) that public outreach and private partnerships are promoted.

[10:1:66,486] environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support, and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office  

[10:2:66,496] performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as  

[10:3:66,506] other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with scientific tools and information upon which to base risk-

[10:4:66,516] management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing hazards and   health risks, including risks to children and other  

[10:5:66,525] sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, and fish and  

[10:6:66,535] shellfish, as well as health and environmental impacts from climate change. The Office also evaluates community pollution  

[10:7:66,545] burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities and reduce exposures and  

[10:8:66,555] risks to residents.

[4:0:66,107] The Health Risk Assessment program conducts scientific assessments of health and environmental risks of chemicals that  

[4:1:66,117] enter the environment from many different sources. The program: identifies chemicals with the potential to cause adverse  

[4:2:66,127] health effects; quantifies risks and recommends health-based goals and standards; develops scientific policies and guidelines  

[4:3:66,136] for hazard identification and risk assessment; and provides medical, scientific, and public health support, consultation, and  

[5:0:66,146] training to state regulators, local governmental agencies, and the public.   The program pays particular attention to protecting the  

[5:1:66,156] health of infants and children and other sensitive populations. The program also evaluates community pollution burdens and  

[5:2:66,166] vulnerabilities.
