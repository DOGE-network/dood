[1:0:243,43] 0130   Joint Expenses  

[2:0:66,64] The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and  

[2:1:66,74] establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal  

[2:2:66,84] and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee.  

[2:3:66,102] Because the Legislature's   programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to  

[2:4:66,112] support this need.   For the specifics on the Legislature's   capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[12:0:66,549] The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was  

[12:1:66,560] completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for  

[12:2:66,570] construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.   The Annex, which was  

[12:3:66,580] completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices.  

[12:4:66,598] Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored,  

[12:5:66,608] rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

[1:0:139,43] 0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System  

[1:1:66,64] Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional  

[1:2:66,74] officers, and legislative statutory officers.  

[2:0:66,95] The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of  

[2:1:66,105] its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,  

[2:2:66,115] disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.   The Legislators'  

[2:3:66,125] Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 

[3:0:66,146] Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November  

[3:1:66,156] 6, 1990.   Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340)  

[3:2:66,166] closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory  

[3:3:66,176] officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

[1:0:208,43] 0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau  

[2:0:66,64] The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members  

[2:1:66,74] and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The  

[2:2:66,84] legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of legislative  

[2:3:66,95] committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is  

[2:4:66,105] confidential.  

[3:0:66,125] In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative  

[3:1:66,135] measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes.  

[4:0:66,156] The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative  

[4:1:66,166] information system and the processing of legislative measures.  

[5:0:66,186] Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the  

[5:1:66,197] Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws recommended by the  

[5:2:66,207] National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these uniform acts.  

[5:3:66,225] Pursuant to Chapter 450 of the Statutes of 2018, the Bureau provides advice and investigation services to the Legislature  

[5:4:66,235] related to workplace misconduct through the Workplace Conduct Unit.

[1:0:242,43] 0250   Judicial Branch  

[2:0:66,64] Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of  

[2:1:66,74] the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.  

[2:2:66,84] Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially  

[2:3:66,95] unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.  

[3:0:66,115] The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent  

[4:0:66,125] funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was  

[4:1:66,135] implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This  

[5:0:66,146] implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The  

[5:1:66,156] county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty  

[6:0:66,166] revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments  

[6:1:66,176] to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted  

[6:2:66,186] by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act  

[6:3:66,197] of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the  

[6:4:66,207] counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial  

[7:0:66,217] Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are  

[7:1:66,227] deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of  

[8:0:66,237] court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities  

[8:1:66,248] based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.  

[9:0:66,268] The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,  

[9:1:66,278] impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United  

[9:2:66,288] States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.  

[10:0:66,309] Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay  

[10:1:66,319] program to support this need. For additional information regarding the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see  

[10:2:66,329] "Infrastructure Overview."

[22:1:82,584] funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc. 

[23:0:82,590] 2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees. 

[23:1:82,598] 3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 superior courts based on courts' final certified 2018-19 Schedule 1 submissions.  

[24:0:82,606] 4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.
[25:0:82,613] 5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’  

[25:1:82,619] state funding in Section 1. 

[26:0:82,625] 6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and  

[26:1:82,631] Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total  

[26:2:82,637] expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total". 

[27:0:82,642] 7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences. For the current  

[27:1:82,648] year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation. 

[28:0:82,654] 8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2017-18 and estimated expenditures for 2018-19 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2019-20 Enacted Budget.

[16:0:54,549] 1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF), General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers'  

[16:1:54,557] Compensation Fund (JBWCF). The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed  

[16:2:54,564] dependency counsel). 

[17:0:54,572] 2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions"  

[17:1:54,580] display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State  

[17:2:54,586] Trial Court Funding Total".  

[18:0:54,595] 3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the  

[18:1:54,603] Trial Court Information section ($127.4 million in 2017-18 and $138.3 million in 2018-19). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In  

[18:2:54,609] addition, 23 courts in 2017-18 and 2018-19 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.
[19:0:54,618] 4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program.  

[19:1:54,626] Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. 

[20:0:54,635] 5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF. For  

[20:1:54,643] the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.

[6:2:66,198] Angeles (7,600 sf). The courts of appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of  

[6:3:66,208] approximately 508,000 sf. The trial courts are located in 58 counties statewide, in approximately 500 buildings and 2,100  

[6:4:66,218] courtrooms of approximately 16 million sf of usable area and more than 21 million sf of space under Judicial Council  

[6:5:66,228] responsibility and management. The facilities of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and trial courts encompass not only the  

[6:6:66,239] public courtroom spaces but also the chambers and workspaces where judicial officers and courtroom staff prepare for  

[6:7:66,249] proceedings; secure areas, including holding cells; and building support functions. Judicial Council administrative facilities,  

[6:8:66,259] occupying approximately 260,000 sf, are located in San Francisco and Sacramento.

[1:0:180,43] 0280   Commission on Judicial Performance  

[2:0:66,64] The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of  

[2:1:66,74] judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California  

[2:2:66,84] Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of  

[2:3:66,95] California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or  

[2:4:66,105] resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.  

[2:5:66,115] In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.  

[3:0:66,135] The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial  

[3:1:66,146] misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation  

[3:2:66,156] and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal  

[3:3:66,166] from office.  

[4:0:66,186] The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the  

[4:1:66,197] Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,  

[4:2:66,207] and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.  

[4:3:66,217] Commission members do not receive a salary.

[1:0:150,43] 0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System  

[2:0:66,64] The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and  

[2:1:66,74] Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement  

[2:2:66,84] System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.  

[3:0:66,102] The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in  

[3:1:66,112] 1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System  

[3:2:66,123] II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final  

[3:3:66,133] compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement  

[3:4:66,143] System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of  

[3:5:66,153] contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined  

[3:6:66,163] benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives  

[3:7:66,174] contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted  

[3:8:66,184] annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.  

[4:0:66,204] The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,  

[4:1:66,214] compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges  

[4:2:66,225] and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing  

[4:3:66,235] fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit  

[4:4:66,245] payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the  

[4:5:66,255] required benefit payments to retired judges.  

[5:0:66,276] Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of  

[5:1:66,286] 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

[1:0:199,43] 0552   Office of the Inspector General  

[2:0:66,64] The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional  

[2:1:66,74] system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's  

[2:2:66,84] (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, and the employee disciplinary process. When requested by the Governor,  

[2:3:66,95] the Senate Committee on Rules, or the Speaker of the Assembly, the Inspector General reviews the policies, practices, and  

[2:4:66,105] procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the  

[2:5:66,115] state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the state's juvenile facilities, and   conducts metric-oriented  

[2:6:66,125] inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at each state prison. OIG receives communications from  

[2:7:66,135] individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of  

[2:8:66,146] wrongdoing by employees of CDCR;   conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper  

[2:9:66,156] management where a legally cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews the mishandling of sexual abuse incidents  

[2:10:66,166] within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the state correctional system by publicly reporting  

[2:11:66,176] its findings.  

[3:0:66,197] In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various mental  

[3:1:66,207] health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at least twice  

[3:2:66,217] annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment programs. The Board  

[3:3:66,227] also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of  

[3:4:66,237] treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of offender participation  

[3:5:66,248] and success.

[0:0:66,13] 2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LJE   114   LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE 

[1:0:202,43] 0690   Office of Emergency Services  

[2:0:66,64] The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build capabilities, and  

[2:1:66,74] support our communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's Homeland Security  

[3:0:66,84] Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's homeland security and  

[3:1:66,95] counter-terrorism strategy. The Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting against,  

[3:2:66,105] responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats.  

[4:0:66,123] On a day-to-day basis, Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and  

[5:0:66,133] coordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector  

[5:1:66,143] resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on  

[5:2:66,153] its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with  

[5:3:66,163] those of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.  

[6:0:66,181] During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's  

[6:1:66,191] responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal  

[6:2:66,201] assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the  

[7:0:66,212] development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes  

[7:1:66,222] prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  

[8:0:66,240] The Cal OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS),  

[8:1:66,250] which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and one  

[8:2:66,260] major urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and terrorist  

[8:3:66,270] activity; and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. The  

[8:4:66,280] STAC operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-terrorism, situational  

[8:5:66,291] awareness reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety community. Further, Cal OES  

[8:6:66,301] improves the criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical assistance to local governments, state  

[8:7:66,311] agencies, and the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim services.  

[9:0:66,329] Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this  

[9:1:66,339] need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

[8:0:66,294] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES  

[9:0:66,312] • California Disaster Assistance Act   — The Budget includes an augmentation of $28.8 million one-time General Fund to  

[9:1:66,322] increase the amount of funding available through the California Disaster Assistance Act (CDAA), which is used to repair,  

[9:2:66,332] restore, or replace public real property damaged or destroyed by a disaster, and to reimburse local governments for costs  

[9:3:66,343] associated with certain emergency activities undertaken in response to a state of emergency. This augmentation increases  

[9:4:66,353] total available funding for CDAA to $91.4 million in 2019-20.  

[10:0:66,371] • Public Safety Power Shutdown — The Budget includes $75 million one-time General Fund to improve resiliency of the state's  

[10:1:66,381] critical infrastructure and provide grants to communities to improve local planning and preparedness in response to utility-led  

[10:2:66,391] Public Safety Power Shutdown   events.  

[11:0:66,409] • State Emergency Telephone Number Account, Broadbrand Communication,   and 9-1-1 Advancements and   Integration   — The  

[11:1:66,419] Budget includes a $50 million one-time General Fund investment, that will be deposited into the State Emergency Telephone  

[11:2:66,429] Network Account (SETNA),   to continue implementing improvements to the state's 9-1-1 system. In addition, the Budget  

[11:3:66,439] includes $1 million ongoing SETNA to support the implementation and workload associated with emergency communications  

[11:4:66,449] coordination and First Responder Network Authority broadband network services.  

[12:0:66,467] • Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery — The Budget includes $26.6 million General Fund and $900,000 Federal  

[12:1:66,477] Trust Fund (FTF)   in 2019-20 and $6.6 million General Fund   and $900,000 FTF ongoing to enhance the state's disaster  

[12:2:66,488] preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities, support the continuity of state government during disasters, and maximize  

[12:3:66,498] eligible federal reimbursements.  

[13:0:66,515] • Mutual Aid System — The Budget includes $25 million ongoing General Fund for prepositioning of existing OES and local  

[13:1:66,526] government resources that are part of the statewide mutual aid system with the goal of enhancing disaster response readiness.  

[13:2:66,536] Prepositioning occurs in areas of identified potential fire threat, which is determined through various means such as weather  

[13:3:66,546] modeling, high wind zones, low humidity, and dense fire load. The prepositioned resources include, but are not limited to, fire  

[13:4:66,556] engines, trucks, personnel, and strike teams. 

[14:0:66,574] • California Earthquake Early Warning System   — The Budget includes $16.3 million one-time General Fund to complete  

[14:1:66,584] activities associated with finishing the build-out of the California Earthquake Early Warning System, including finishing seismic  

[14:2:66,594] stations installation, adding GPS stations to the network, improving telemetry, and launching a statewide education and  

[14:3:66,605] outreach campaign. The California Earthquake Early Warning System is anticipated to be operative statewide by June 2021. 

[15:0:66,622] • California State Nonprofit Security Grant Program — The Budget includes $15 million one-time General Fund to support  

[15:1:66,632] target hardening and other physical security enhancements to assist non-profit organizations that are at high risk of a terrorist

[5:1:66,125] state, and local resources, through the mutual aid system to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended in a  

[5:2:66,135] disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-hazards  

[5:3:66,145] approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National Strategy on  

[5:4:66,156] Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this program,  

[5:5:66,166] Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to all

[7:5:66,262] financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center which is the  

[7:6:66,273] centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion  

[7:7:66,283] center.  

[8:0:66,301] 0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS  

[9:0:66,321] Public Safety Communications (PSC) serves the State of California by providing public safety communications to the state's  

[9:1:66,331] first responders and oversight of the 9-1-1 system to the people of California. The PSC is dedicated to the preservation and  

[9:2:66,341] protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services keeping the public

[8:0:66,390] 0435 - LEGAL SERVICES  

[9:0:66,410] Legal Services is organized into three elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law, and (3) Public Rights.  

[10:0:66,431] Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in  

[10:1:66,441] civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them and prosecutes cases to vindicate state  

[10:2:66,451] interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative  

[10:3:66,461] tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and  

[10:4:66,471] California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of   nine sections: Business and Tax; Cannabis Control; Correctional Law;  

[10:5:66,482] Employment and Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement;  

[10:6:66,492] Licensing; or Tort and Condemnation.  

[11:0:66,512] Criminal Law represents the   People of the State of California   in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts.  

[11:1:66,522] Criminal Law also fulfills the Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are  

[11:2:66,533] recused, conducts criminal investigations, represents the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of  

[11:3:66,543] Corrections and Rehabilitation in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole  

[11:4:66,553] decisions and conditions of confinement in the state prisons and defends criminal judgements in state and federal habeas  

[11:5:66,563] corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition  

[11:6:66,573] matters, investigating and prosecuting Medi-Cal provider fraud, investigating and prosecuting the abuse or neglect of elder and  

[11:7:66,584] dependent adults residing in long-term health care facilities, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving  

[11:8:66,594] white-collar crime, high-tech/computer/privacy crime, financial crimes against the elderly, human trafficking, environmental  

[11:9:66,604] crimes, and public corruption.  

[12:0:66,624] Public Rights protects and preserves the public interest by providing legal services to state agencies and Constitutional Officers  

[12:1:66,635] and by bringing actions in the name of the Attorney General to protect the public. Public Rights provides specialized services in  

[12:2:66,645] the following areas: Civil Rights Enforcement (including Underground Economy and the Bureau of Children's Justice);  

[12:3:66,655] Charitable Trusts (including the Registry of Charitable Trusts); Natural Resources Law; Corporate Fraud (including False

[1:0:410,13] 2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LJE   143 

[2:0:189,32] 0820   Department of Justice - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five elements: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3)  

[3:1:66,79] Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief.  

[4:0:66,99] The Bureau of Firearms provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms and  

[4:1:66,109] ammunitions   laws by conducting firearms eligibility background checks and administering over thirty different state-mandated  

[4:2:66,120] firearms-related programs. The Bureau conducts firearms dealer and manufacturer inspections for compliance, and provides  

[4:3:66,130] training as needed. Special Agents conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting  

[4:4:66,140] in the seizure of firearms, magazines, and ammunition. Agents also conduct investigations to monitor and   prevent  

[4:5:66,150] illegal   firearm trafficking at permitted gun shows in accordance with state and federal laws.  

[5:0:66,171] The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence, including crime scene  

[5:1:66,181] investigation and expert court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts, by

[6:0:66,222] The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly and  

[6:1:66,232] is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and  

[6:2:66,242] business entities who apply for state gambling licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance  

[6:3:66,252] with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. Furthermore, the Bureau conducts criminal investigations in, on or  

[6:4:66,262] about Tribal casinos and California cardrooms. The Bureau also regulates Tribal gaming to ensure that each Tribe is in  

[6:5:66,273] compliance with all aspects of the negotiated gaming compact.  

[7:0:66,293] The Bureau of Investigation is the premiere investigative agency that is responsible for exploiting and dismantling criminal  

[7:1:66,303] organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses which present a significant and multi-

[7:2:66,313] jurisdictional threat to California. The Bureau prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal organizations involved in  

[7:3:66,324] gangs and human trafficking, as well as cases involving environmental crimes, public corruption, major white-collar   fraud,  

[7:4:66,334] underground economy, recycle fraud, foreign prosecution assistance agencies,   and high-technology crimes. In addition, the  

[7:5:66,344] Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership, coordination, and support to law enforcement through multi-agency drug,  

[7:6:66,354] gang and major crimes task forces statewide.  

[8:0:66,375] The Office of the Chief enhances public safety by providing training, technical, and administrative support to the investigative,  

[8:1:66,385] regulatory and forensic components of the Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office serves  

[8:2:66,395] as the policy-making and oversight body for its four operational bureaus.  

[9:0:66,413] 0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES  

[10:0:66,430] The California Justice Information Services Division provides criminal justice intelligence, information, and identification  

[10:1:66,441] services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary services:  

[10:2:66,451] 1) The Bureau of Criminal Identification & Investigative Services consolidates the identification, investigative, and field services  

[10:3:66,461] functions, providing information and technical assistance on manual and automated systems including the fingerprint

[10:7:66,502] California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System; and 4) the Operations Support Program provides business

[3:3:66,153] and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than 28,000  

[3:4:66,163] suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 7,250 rate filing applications annually; and

[7:0:66,365] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[8:0:66,384] 0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS  

[9:0:66,401] The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of  

[9:1:66,412] insurers, including the review of complex, principles-based reserving methods to avoid reliance on black box models; (2)  

[9:2:66,422] prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and casualty  

[9:3:66,432] insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code and the  

[9:4:66,442] California Code of Regulations; (4) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and  

[9:5:66,452] attempt to get unreasonable rates lowered by insurers; and (5) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of  

[9:6:66,463] insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and Liquidation Office, the  

[9:7:66,473] CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies.  

[9:8:66,490] 0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION  

[10:0:66,508] The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders  

[10:1:66,518] and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating or  

[10:2:66,529] underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or fraudulent practices or  

[10:3:66,539] incompetence relating to the sale of insurance and (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities.  

[10:4:66,556] 0530 - FRAUD CONTROL  

[11:0:66,574] The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for  

[11:1:66,584] prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed  

[11:2:66,595] by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program also  

[11:3:66,605] implements the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower  

[11:4:66,615] "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud.  

[11:5:66,633] 0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE  

[12:0:66,650] This program performs tax collection; ensures compliance from insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws  

[12:1:66,661] contained in the Insurance Code and Revenue and Taxation Code; and works with California Department of Tax and Fee  

[12:2:66,671] Administration and State Controller's Office with various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the premium  

[12:3:66,681] tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.  

[13:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:183,43] 0850   California State Lottery Commission  

[2:0:66,64] In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an  

[2:1:66,74] initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it  

[2:2:66,84] broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to  

[2:3:66,95] benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by  

[2:4:66,105] the State Senate.  

[3:0:66,125] The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34  

[3:1:66,135] percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be  

[3:2:66,146] used for administrative costs.  

[4:0:66,166] In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost  

[4:1:66,176] limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of  

[4:2:66,186] contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery  

[4:3:66,197] Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily  

[4:4:66,207] Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the  

[4:5:66,217] University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.  

[5:0:66,237] In the 33 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2018, the California State Lottery has raised $34.2 billion  

[5:1:66,248] for public education, including $1.7 billion in FY 2017-18.  

[6:0:66,268] Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2018-19 and 2019-20 cannot be made  

[6:1:66,278] with certainty.

[9:1:66,296] (CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires  

[9:2:66,306] the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,  

[9:3:66,316] giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,  

[9:4:66,327] and loans to the General Fund.  

[10:0:66,344] The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of  

[10:1:66,355] the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that  

[10:2:66,365] the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer  

[10:3:66,375] maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for  

[10:4:66,385] the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies.  

[11:0:66,403] The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts  

[11:1:66,413] available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer  

[11:2:66,423] of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for  

[11:3:66,433] payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities  

[11:4:66,444] pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other  

[11:5:66,454] state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or  

[11:6:66,464] pledged to the state.  

[12:0:66,482] 0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE  

[13:0:66,499] The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes,  

[13:1:66,510] revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The  

[13:2:66,520] Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to  

[13:3:66,530] bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.  

[14:0:66,548] The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to state debt so there is no adverse consequences to  

[14:1:66,558] bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance for various state debt includes  

[14:2:66,568] monitoring the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial  

[14:3:66,578] disclosure, and ensuring proper record keeping.  

[15:0:66,596] 0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES  

[16:0:66,614] The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support  

[16:1:66,624] services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems,  

[16:2:66,634] business services, technical support, and production operations.

[5:4:66,210] (such as tuition, fees, supplies, books, computer equipment, and certain room and board expenses) at eligible educational

[1:0:165,43] 0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee  

[2:0:66,64] The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State  

[2:1:66,74] of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,  

[2:2:66,84] such as the creation of affordable housing.  

[3:0:66,105] The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual  

[3:1:66,115] basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by  

[3:2:66,125] multiplying the state population by $105. California's limit totaled over $4.1 billion in 2018. (California's limit for the Qualified  

[3:3:66,135] Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $395  

[3:4:66,146] million for 2018.)  

[4:0:66,166] The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers  

[4:1:66,176] authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state  

[4:2:66,186] or federal government.  

[5:0:66,207] The Committee administers   six active programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private  

[5:1:66,217] activity bonds.   The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the  

[5:2:66,227] Governor, or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

[4:0:66,89] Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily  

[4:1:66,99] rental housing to acquire land and construct new housing or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers  

[4:2:66,109] produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and  

[4:3:66,120] families. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits using the  

[4:4:66,130] California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint Application.

[7:3:66,273] communities.  

[8:0:66,293] Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance solid waste disposal and waste recycling  

[8:1:66,303] facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities

[13:3:66,698] generated by the proposed project, particularly those benefits associated with job creation, and determines whether these  

[13:4:66,709] benefits will significantly outweigh any detrimental public effects. Eligible capital expenditures include the acquisition of land,

[1:0:166,43] 0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee  

[2:0:66,64] The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and  

[2:1:66,74] maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming  

[2:2:66,84] partnerships with developers, investors and public entities.  

[3:0:66,105] The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years  

[3:1:66,115] after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with income and rent restrictions related to the tax credit programs of the  

[3:2:66,125] Committee. Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create  

[3:3:66,135] and maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing.  

[4:0:66,156] The Committee consists of seven members, including three voting members and four advisors. The voting members are the  

[4:1:66,166] Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her  

[4:2:66,176] representative), and the State Controller. The non-voting (advisory) members are the Director of Housing and Community  

[4:3:66,186] Development, the Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and two local government representatives.  

[4:4:66,197] One local representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a  

[4:5:66,207] county government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

[5:0:66,243] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[5:1:66,261] 0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE  

[6:0:66,281] The Federal Program  

[7:0:66,302] Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax  

[7:1:66,312] incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise  

[7:2:66,322] project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and  

[7:3:66,332] indexed for inflation. 

[8:0:66,353] Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the  

[8:1:66,363] percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability  

[8:2:66,373] annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of  

[8:3:66,383] the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project  

[8:4:66,393] sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each  

[8:5:66,404] year for a ten-year period.  

[9:0:66,421] The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation.   For 2018, each  

[9:1:66,431] state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.40 per   state resident.   Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share  

[9:2:66,442] of unused credits in a national pool.  

[10:0:66,459] Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects  

[10:1:66,470] must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there  

[10:2:66,480] is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments.  

[10:3:66,497] Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires  

[10:4:66,508] maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.  

[11:0:66,536] The State LIHTC Program  

[12:0:66,556] In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the  

[12:1:66,566] federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for  

[12:2:66,576] an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax  

[12:3:66,587] credit status.  

[13:0:66,607] The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2018, was $98.6 million. Investors take the state tax credit  

[13:1:66,617] annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.  

[14:0:66,638] Farmworker Housing Program  

[15:0:66,658] Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state  

[15:1:66,668] LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,  

[15:2:66,678] these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and  

[15:3:66,689] projects may receive state credits even if they receive an increase in their federal tax credit basis.  

[16:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[1:0:88,43] 0971   California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing  

[1:1:279,57] Authority  

[2:0:66,78] The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes  

[2:1:66,89] of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently  

[2:2:66,99] utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the  

[2:3:66,109] environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  

[2:4:66,119] providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,  

[2:5:66,129] implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and  

[2:6:66,140] lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit  

[2:7:66,150] enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities  

[2:8:66,160] needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.  

[3:0:66,180] The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director  

[3:1:66,191] of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,  

[3:2:66,201] and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

[2:0:88,32] 0971   California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing 

[2:1:244,47] Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the  

[3:1:66,79] authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as  

[3:2:66,89] determined and approved by resolution of the Authority.  

[4:0:66,109] In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative  

[4:1:66,120] source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012, expanded  

[4:2:66,130] the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter  

[4:3:66,140] 768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock  

[4:4:66,150] and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. The objective of this program is to  

[4:5:66,160] promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases,  

[4:6:66,171] air and water pollution, and energy consumption.  

[5:0:66,191] Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013  

[5:1:66,201] (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority  

[5:2:66,211] developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for residential  

[5:3:66,222] whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for residential Property  

[5:4:66,232] Assessed Clean Energy programs in California.  

[6:0:66,252] Most recently, the Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf  

[6:1:66,262] of, and in collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot programs will  

[6:2:66,273] employ various types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and  

[6:3:66,283] commercial sectors) for energy efficiency improvements needed to help achieve California's energy efficiency goals.

[5:1:66,137] for Small Businesses is a form of loan loss recovery that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By  

[5:2:66,148] participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the financing needs of  

[5:3:66,158] California's small businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating  

[5:4:66,168] financial institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional  

[6:0:66,178] incentives are provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk,  

[6:1:66,188] allowing banks to lend to targeted California small businesses. Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General  

[6:2:66,199] Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts. As of June 30, 2018, approximately $750,000 of the $6 million remained in the  

[6:3:66,209] State-funded program account to assist small businesses.  

[7:0:66,229] In addition, California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168.6 million from the federal State Small  

[7:1:66,239] Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The Authority and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (Go-BIZ)  

[7:2:66,250] equally share this allocation of $84.3 million each. These funds have enabled the Authority to expand the availability of its  

[7:3:66,260] CalCAP program statewide. The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to assist more small businesses and  

[7:4:66,270] utilize the SSBCI federal funds.   As of June 30, 2018,   the federally-funded program account to assist small businesses under  

[7:5:66,280] the CalCAP loan loss reserve program was fully-expended. Approximately $1 million remained in the federally-funded program  

[7:6:66,290] account for the Collateral Support Program, obligated to pre-approved loans. Funds are being recaptured to sustain both  

[7:7:66,301] programs.  

[8:0:66,321] Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck and  

[8:1:66,331] equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $107.3 million in Air Quality Improvement  

[8:2:66,341] Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The  

[8:3:66,352] Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit  

[8:4:66,362] enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations. Similarly, the Authority is  

[8:5:66,372] partnering with the Department of Resources, Recycling, and Recovery to assist with the financing of important state recycling  

[8:6:66,382] objectives.  

[9:0:66,400] 0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM  

[10:0:66,418] The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived  

[11:0:66,428] contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties  

[11:1:66,438] (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program  

[11:2:66,448] provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000, which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with  

[11:3:66,458] brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible  

[11:4:66,469] projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or  

[11:5:66,479] perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process.  

[12:0:66,496] Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund  

[13:0:66,507] brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received  

[13:1:66,517] $60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided up to $5 million per project in loans and grants for the purpose of brownfield  

[13:2:66,527] cleanup that promotes affordable infill residential and mixed-used development. All CALReUSE Program funds have been  

[13:3:66,537] awarded. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,618 housing units  

[13:4:66,547] in 30 California communities.  

[14:0:66,565] 0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS  

[15:0:66,583] Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative  

[15:1:66,593] energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's  

[15:2:66,603] environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and  

[15:3:66,613] state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.  

[16:0:66,631] 0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT  

[17:0:66,649] The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal  

[17:1:66,659] Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other  

[17:2:66,669] financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the  

[17:3:66,679] Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the  

[17:4:66,690] CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program.  

[18:0:66,736] * Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.

[4:0:66,89] The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time  

[4:1:66,99] allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to create an accessible loan program to qualified small businesses and  

[4:2:66,109] residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of  

[4:3:66,120] Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other  

[4:4:66,130] financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the  

[4:5:66,140] program. The loans to small businesses and residential property owners are for financing seismic retrofits of real property to  

[4:6:66,150] reduce losses and mitigate seismic damage.

[4:0:66,239] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[4:1:66,257] 0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,275] In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3  

[5:1:66,285] established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program.  

[5:2:66,296] The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable  

[5:3:66,306] and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is  

[5:4:66,316] derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition  

[5:5:66,326] 3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4.  

[5:6:66,344] 0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES GRANTS AND LOANS  

[6:0:66,364] The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health  

[6:1:66,374] institutions.  

[7:0:66,395] Tax-Exempt Bond Program  

[8:0:66,415] Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of  

[8:1:66,425] the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of  

[8:2:66,436] the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or  

[8:3:66,446] association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district.  

[9:0:66,466] Lifeline Grant Program  

[10:0:66,487] Chapter 52, Statutes of 2017 (SB 97) authorized the Authority to approve grants of up to $20 million dollars from the HELP II  

[10:1:66,497] Loan Program subfund account. The Lifeline Grant Program assists small and rural health facilities, including community-based  

[10:2:66,507] clinics, that may be adversely affected financially by a reduction or elimination of federal government assistance and that have  

[10:3:66,517] little to no access to working capital. Grants must be awarded by June 30, 2020.  

[11:0:66,538] HELP II Loan Program  

[12:0:66,558] The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in  

[12:1:66,568] obtaining financing for their capital needs. The HELP II Program provides two percent and three percent fixed interest rate  

[12:2:66,578] loans of up to $1,500,000 to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost effective  

[12:3:66,589] manner. HELP II loans may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities, purchase  

[12:4:66,599] equipment and/or furnishings, and refinance existing debt.  

[13:0:66,619] California Health Access Model Program  

[14:0:66,640] Chapter 23, Statutes of 2012 (AB 1467) authorized the California Health Access Model Program (CHAMP), a grant program  

[14:1:66,650] intended to support innovative methods of delivering health care services and improve health outcomes for vulnerable  

[14:2:66,660] populations and communities by bringing services to individuals where they live or congregate.

[13:0:66,660] On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which  

[13:1:66,670] allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can  

[13:2:66,680] make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings.  

[13:3:66,691] ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability  

[13:4:66,701] expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the  

[13:5:66,711] State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.

[8:2:66,397] Sacramento-Yolo Port District, the Stockton Port District, and those metropolitan statistical areas meeting specified conditions.  

[8:3:66,407] The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that bonds authorized by the Authority generally be within an allocation from the  

[8:4:66,417] state's ''private activity'' bond limit in order for the bonds to be federally tax-exempt, unless the issuer qualifies as a private,  

[8:5:66,428] nonprofit business.  

[9:0:66,448] Financing is available for both publicly and privately sponsored projects that provide visitor-serving facilities, waterfront-

[9:1:66,458] dependent industries, public recreation, and erosion control facilities. The State Coastal Conservancy must approve both the  

[9:2:66,468] specific project and a master plan for urban waterfront restoration before any project can obtain the Authority approval for

[3:0:66,69] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[3:1:66,87] 0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM  

[4:0:66,107] Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance  

[4:1:66,118] of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and  

[4:2:66,128] community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,  

[4:3:66,138] reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB  

[4:4:66,148] 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.  

[4:5:66,166] 0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM  

[5:0:66,186] Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program  

[5:1:66,196] (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the  

[5:2:66,207] Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University  

[5:3:66,217] Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50  

[5:4:66,227] percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the  

[5:5:66,237] state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be  

[5:6:66,247] deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements.  

[5:7:66,265] 0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM  

[6:0:66,286] In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School  

[6:1:66,296] Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.  

[6:2:66,306] Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities  

[6:3:66,316] or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on  

[6:4:66,326] preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and  

[6:5:66,337] demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding.  

[6:6:66,354] 0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM  

[7:0:66,375] The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and  

[7:1:66,385] lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged  

[7:2:66,395] students. Eligible charter schools are provided up to $1,187 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, not to exceed 75  

[7:3:66,405] percent of their total annual facilities rent or lease costs.  

[7:4:66,423] 0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND  

[8:0:66,443] Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of  

[8:1:66,454] up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is  

[8:2:66,464] available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference is given to schools that  

[8:3:66,474] have not completed their full charter term.

[12:1:66,595] 0940 - BOND FINANCING  

[13:0:66,612] CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational  

[13:1:66,622] facilities.   Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds,   CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms  

[13:2:66,633] than might otherwise be obtainable.   CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the  

[13:3:66,643] construction of student and faculty housing.   Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or  

[13:4:66,653] the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions.   The full faith and credit of the participating  

[13:5:66,663] institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds.   Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private  

[13:6:66,673] activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law.  

[14:0:66,691] For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private  

[14:1:66,701] college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on his or her race or ethnicity, provided that the financing does  

[14:2:66,712] not violate constitutional provisions.

[2:0:133,32] 0989   California Educational Facilities Authority - Continued 

[3:0:66,69] "Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness.   This broad definition allows CEFA to  

[3:1:66,79] issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than  

[3:2:66,89] these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.  

[4:0:66,109] 0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND  

[5:0:66,129] Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the  

[5:1:66,139] tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017.   Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,  

[5:2:66,150] added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January  

[5:3:66,160] 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018.   Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax
