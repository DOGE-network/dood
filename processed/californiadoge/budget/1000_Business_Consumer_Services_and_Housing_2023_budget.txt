[11:0:66,546] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS  

[11:1:66,565] 1100 - CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY  

[12:0:66,584] The California Board of Accountancy regulates the largest group of accounting professionals in the nation. By authority of the  

[12:1:66,594] California Accountancy Act, the Board qualifies California candidates for the National Uniform Certified Public Accountant  

[12:2:66,604] (CPA) Examination; certifies, licenses, and renews licenses of individual CPAs and Public Accountants (PA); registers  

[12:3:66,613] accountancy partnerships and corporations; oversees the practice privilege (mobility) program; receives and investigates  

[12:4:66,623] complaints; takes enforcement actions against licensees for violation of Board statutes and regulations; monitors compliance  

[12:5:66,633] with continuing education requirements; and reviews the work products of CPAs, PAs, and CPA firms to ensure adherence to  

[12:6:66,643] professional standards.  

[12:7:66,660] 1105 - CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTS BOARD  

[13:0:66,680] The California Architects Board's objectives are to ensure that only those persons possessing the necessary minimum  

[13:1:66,689] qualifications are licensed as architects, to enforce the provisions of the Architect Practice Act and subsequent regulations, and  

[13:2:66,699] to establish and enforce levels of professional competence, eliminate unlicensed activity, and provide consumer/industry  

[13:3:66,709] education. The Board also maintains purview and jurisdiction over the Landscape Architects Technical Committee, which
