[2:2:66,84] provides centralized IT services to state and local governments as well as non-governmental entities. The Department 

[2:3:66,95] promulgates statewide IT security policies and procedures, and has responsibility over telecommunication and IT 

[2:4:66,105] procurements.

[1:0:196,43] 7760   Department of General Services 

[2:0:66,64] The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides 

[3:0:66,74] centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and 

[3:1:66,84] construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building; 

[3:2:66,95] printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's 

[4:0:66,105] vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve 

[4:1:66,115] California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions. 

[5:0:66,133] Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 

[5:1:66,143] this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

[4:1:66,119] 6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION 

[5:0:66,136] This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer 

[5:1:66,147] financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a 

[5:2:66,157] claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 

[5:3:66,174] 6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 

[6:0:66,192] This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery 

[6:1:66,202] of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community 

[6:2:66,213] (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition 

[6:3:66,223] and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 

[6:4:66,233] the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities. 

[6:5:66,251] 6390 - GOVERNMENT CLAIMS 

[6:6:66,268] This program receives, investigates, and processes claims for money or damages filed against the state. 

[6:7:66,286] 6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN 

[7:0:66,304] This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that 

[7:1:66,314] benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

[11:0:66,567] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[11:1:65,585] •   The Budget includes an increase to the state's pension contribution due to the CalPERS Board's action in 2016 to lower the 

[11:2:76,595] assumed rate of return for the system. The assumption change increased the system's liabilities, resulting in an increase to 

[11:3:76,605] the state's funding obligation. The reduction in the assumed rate of return, from 7.5 to 7 percent, is being phased in over 

[11:4:76,616] three years; this is the second year of the phase-in. 

[12:0:65,632] •   The Budget also includes $623.5 million within the Proposition 2 debt payment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s 

[12:1:76,642] portion of a loan from the Surplus Money Investment Fund. This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension 

[12:2:76,652] payment to CalPERS in 2017-18. The payment was made to mitigate the increase in state contributions due to the lower 

[12:3:76,662] assumed rate of return, as described above, and has been apportioned accordingly to the five state retirement plans based 

[12:4:76,673] on the unfunded liability of each plan.

[13:1:112,328] 2/  The 2018 Budget Act estimates 2018-19 state contributions to CalPERS to be $6,189,583,000. The reduction in this estimate from the  

[13:2:112,339] 2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act reflects a decrease in the five state plans' employer contribution rates, with the exception  

[13:3:112,348] of the state safety plan, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2018 meeting. 

[14:0:112,358] 3/ The 2018 Budget Act estimates 2018-19 administrative expenditures to be $377,990,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of  

[14:1:112,368] Administration at its May 2018 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act is  

[14:2:112,377] primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits. 

[15:0:112,387] 4/ The 2018 Budget Act estimates 2018-19 other expenditures to be $860,430,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at  

[15:1:112,398] its May 2018 meeting. The net decrease to this estimate from the 2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act is primarily due to an  

[15:2:112,407] increase in investment operating costs and a decrease in investment external management fees.

[1:0:433,24] GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 

[2:0:143,38] 7900   Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued 

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[3:1:66,91] 6410 - RETIREMENT 

[4:0:66,111] CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for 

[4:1:66,121] employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of 

[4:2:66,131] duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2017, there were about 1,257,000 active and inactive members, and 

[4:3:66,142] about 668,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 

[5:0:66,162] Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. 

[5:1:66,172] There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter, 

[5:2:66,182] California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract 

[5:3:66,193] with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit 

[5:4:66,203] formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions. 

[6:0:66,223] As of June 30, 2017, there were 2,945 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and 

[6:1:66,233] survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 

[6:2:66,244] careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 

[6:3:66,254] retirement systems. 

[7:0:66,274] CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 

[7:1:66,292] 6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 

[8:0:66,312] The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 

[8:1:66,323] associations, and others to provide health and long-term care insurance for state, California State University, and local public 

[8:2:66,333] agency employees, retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-

[8:3:66,343] effective programs, provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee 

[8:4:66,353] organizations and employer representatives. 

[9:0:66,374] Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 

[9:1:66,384] Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 

[9:2:66,394] eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial 

[9:3:66,404] intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 

[9:4:66,422] 6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 

[10:0:66,442] Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 

[10:1:66,452] purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 

[10:2:66,463] members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees' 

[10:3:66,473] Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $326.4 billion, as of June 30, 2017. 

[10:4:66,491] 6425 - ADMINISTRATION 

[11:0:66,511] This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 

[11:1:66,521] the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy 

[11:2:66,531] Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Operational 

[11:3:66,542] Support, and Public Affairs.

[1:0:206,43] 7910   Office of Administrative Law 

[2:0:66,64] The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state 

[2:1:66,74] regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these 

[2:2:66,84] regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also 

[2:3:66,95] responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been 

[2:4:66,105] recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through 

[2:5:66,115] a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative 

[2:6:66,125] Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members 

[2:7:66,135] of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 

[3:0:66,153] In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 

[3:1:66,163] constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 

[3:2:66,174] Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 

[4:0:66,191] The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the 

[4:1:66,201] California Regulatory Notice Register.

[1:0:187,43] 7920   State Teachers' Retirement System 

[1:1:66,64] The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution 

[1:2:66,74] plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred 

[1:3:66,84] compensation plans and programs: 

[1:4:65,102] •   State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP) 

[2:0:65,118] •   CalSTRS Pension2 Program (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans) 

[2:1:65,135] •   Teachers' Health Benefits Fund 

[2:2:65,151] •   Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund 

[3:0:66,179] CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school 

[3:1:66,189] teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of 

[3:2:66,199] June 30, 2017, there are approximately 933,000 members, retirees and beneficiaries of the STRP Defined Benefit Program. 

[4:0:66,219] CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement 

[4:1:66,230] Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

[10:0:66,542] MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 

[10:1:65,560] •   The Budget includes $3.1 billion General Fund   for state contributions to CalSTRS.   This roughly $300 million year-over-year 

[10:2:76,571] increase is due to an unanticipated increase in payroll growth, and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its 

[10:3:76,581] authority to increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law 

[10:4:76,591] in 2014. The Teachers' Retirement Board adopted changes in demographic and economic assumptions in 2017, which 

[10:5:76,601] resulted in an increase to the system's liabilities, thereby increasing the state's funding obligation. 

[11:0:65,617] •   The Budget also includes $3.4 million and 14 positions to increase internal investment management to achieve CalSTRS' 

[11:1:76,628] investment objectives more effectively. The funding and positions in 2018-19 are the first step of a five-year phase in of 

[11:2:76,638] $15.4 million in permanent funding and 58 positions.

[3:0:66,72] PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 

[3:1:66,91] 6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 

[4:0:66,111] CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the 

[4:1:66,121] distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the 

[4:2:66,131] largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement 

[4:3:66,142] benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may 

[4:4:66,152] modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the 

[4:5:66,162] member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's 

[4:6:66,172] retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or 

[4:7:66,182] contract provisions. 

[5:0:66,203] Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 

[5:1:66,213] General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of 

[5:2:66,223] administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
